    INDUSTRIES OF MAN — THE CHIEF INDUSTRIES OF
    ANIMALS — INTELLIGENCE AND INSTINCT — INSTINCTIVE

	<p><em id="ch_1_1" class="section_title">The naturalists of yesterday and the naturalists of
	to-day.</em> — The study of animals, plants, rocks, and of
	natural objects generally, was formerly called “natural
	history”; but this term is tending to disappear from
	our vocabulary and to give place to the term “natural
	sciences.” What is the reason of this change, and to
	what does it correspond? for it is rare for a word to
	be modified in so short a time if the thing designated
	has not itself varied.</p>

	<p>Exterior forms have certainly changed, and the
	naturalist of yesterday makes upon us the impression
	of a legendary being. I refer to the person described
	<a class="pagenum" id="page2" title="2"> </a>in George Sand’s romances, marching vigorously over
	hills and valleys in search of a rare insect, which he
	pricked with delight, or of a plant difficult to reach,
	which he triumphantly dried and fixed on a leaf of
	paper bearing the date of the discovery and the name
	of the locality. A herbarium became a sort of
	journal, recalling to its fortunate possessor all the
	wanderings of the happy chase, all the delightful
	sounds and sights of the country. Every naturalist
	concealed within him a lover of idylls or eclogues.
	Assuredly all the preliminary studies which resulted
	from these excursions were necessary; we owe gratitude
	to our predecessors, and we profit from their
	labours, sometimes regretting the loss of the picturesque
	fashion in which their researches were carried
	out.</p>

	<p>The naturalist of to-day usually lives more in the
	laboratory than in the country. Occasional expeditions
	to the coast or dredgings are the only links that
	attach him to nature; the scalpel and the microtome
	have replaced the collector’s pins, and the magnifying
	glass gives place to the microscope. When the
	observer begins to pursue his studies in the laboratory
	he no longer cares to pass the threshold. He has
	still so much to learn concerning the most common
	creatures that it seems useless to him to waste his
	time in seeking those that are rarer, unless he takes
	into account the unquestionable pleasure of rambling
	through woods or along coasts; — but such a consideration
	does not belong to the scientific domain.</p>

	<p>A change of conditions of this nature does not
	suffice to create a science. To take away from a
	study all that rendered it pleasant and easy, and to
	make it the property of a small coterie, when it was
	<a class="pagenum" id="page3" title="3"> </a>formerly accessible to all, is not sufficient to render it
	scientific. It is a fatality rather than a triumph to
	have undergone such a change. The change is an
	effect rather than a cause.</p>

	<p>When little or nothing was known it was necessary
	to begin by examining the phenomena which first
	met the eyes of the observer, such as the customs of
	animals and the characters which distinguished them
	from each other. Their differences and resemblances
	were studied; they were formed into groups, classed
	and arranged in an order recalling as much as
	possible their natural relations. In classifying it is
	impossible to consider all the facts or the result
	would be chaos; it is necessary to choose the
	characters and to give preponderance to certain of
	them. This sorting of characters has been executed
	with the sagacity of genius by the illustrious naturalists
	of the last century and the beginning of the
	present. But the frames which they have traced are
	fixed and rigid; nature with her infinite plasticity
	escapes from them. We render a great homage to
	the classifiers when we say that they have confined
	the facts as closely as it is possible to do. The
	catalogues which they have prepared are of a utility
	which is unquestionable, although their <em lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">rôle</em> is to be
	useful only; we cannot pretend to make them the
	expression, the symbol, the formula in which all
	natural phenomena are to be enclosed. To confound
	classification with science is to confound the lever
	with the effect which we expect from it.</p>

	<p>Curiosity, moreover, always impels towards that
	which is least known. External appearances having
	been studied, the form and function of internal organs
	were investigated. Physiology and comparative
	<a class="pagenum" id="page4" title="4"> </a>anatomy were born and developed; researches
	abounded and observers abandoned the field for the
	laboratory.</p>

	<p>The difference in methods of research and the
	pushing of precision to its extreme limits — an inevitable
	result of the different nature of the observations
	to be made — did not however yet render legitimate
	the claim for natural studies to be called “science.”</p>

	<p><em id="ch_1_2" class="section_title">Natural history and the natural sciences.</em> — A
	more important event has taken place. The
	ancient naturalists, like their contemporaries, had
	firm beliefs which they used as unquestionable
	principles for the comprehension of all facts. The
	explanation of an observation was ready in advance.
	The study of facts invariably brought to the pen of
	the writer the same enthusiastic admiration of the
	marvellous part played by Providence in nature.<a href="#footnote_1" id="fnm1"  class="fnmarker">1</a>
	The phenomena in which this action was not
	strikingly apparent were merely described without
	any attempt to relate them with each other, or with
	the other facts. A hypothesis which left a great
	number of facts without explanation was necessarily
	insufficient. The descriptions, in spite of all their
	individual interest, did not constitute a homogeneous
	whole, a science. They were merely a collection of
	more or less natural histories.</p>

	<p>Science only begins on the day when we have
	found the simple theory which binds together all the
	facts at that time known, without of course prejudicing
	the future. As the number of acquired facts
	increases, if the theory in question continues to
	explain the new as it explained the old, the science
	<a class="pagenum" id="page5" title="5"> </a>becomes more firmly established. If we can imagine
	a time arriving when all the possible phenomena are
	known, and the existing hypothesis still explains
	them, nothing henceforth can overturn it, the science
	is completed. That is the simple case in which a
	theory has been victorious; but if it is contradicted
	by a single well-authenticated fact it must fall or
	become modified. The more things a theory explains
	in the present the more chance it has of success in
	the future. It is still only a matter of chances, for
	the theory is always at the mercy of unforeseen
	observation, which may rudely overthrow it.</p>

	<p>There is no theory which must not be modified
	constantly, at least in its details. To render it more
	and more general by successive improvements is the
	aim to be pursued. A collection of studies constitutes
	a science when a hypothesis has arisen already
	sufficiently strong to oblige us to refer to it all new
	acquisitions, and to compel us to see if they fortify or
	oppose it.</p>

	<p>It would indeed be a narrow conception if we were
	to consider as scientific the partisans of the theory
	alone; more than anywhere else discussion is fruitful
	in the natural sciences; and if it is necessary to be
	constantly preoccupied with the general ideas of the
	day, it is not at all necessary to adhere to them
	servilely. The naturalists of to-day are in possession
	of a formula with which we must always preoccupy
	ourselves; in other words, there are natural sciences.</p>

	<p><em id="ch_1_3" class="section_title">The theory of Evolution.</em> — This hypothesis which
	comes before all others is the theory of evolution.
	This is not the place to expound it, to go over
	the proofs which have been amassed to build it
	up, nor the criticisms which have been directed
	<a class="pagenum" id="page6" title="6"> </a>against it. It has to-day come out of the struggle
	victoriously. A prodigious quantity of facts, of comparative
	anatomy and of embryology, inexplicable
	without it, emerge from the chaos and constitute
	a whole, truly and marvellously homogeneous. Issued
	from the natural sciences, the doctrine of evolution
	now overflows them and tends to embrace everything
	that concerns man: history, sociology, political economy,
	psychology. The moralists seek, and will surely
	find, compromises permitting ethical laws to endure
	the rule of this overwhelming hypothesis.</p>

	<p>Without going too far back into history, let us
	look towards the end of the last century and the
	beginning of this. Cuvier, Lamarck,<a href="#footnote_2" id="fnm2"  class="fnmarker">2</a> and Geoffroy
	Saint-Hilaire,<a href="#footnote_3" id="fnm3"  class="fnmarker">3</a> all preoccupied with general ideas,
	were each trying to build up a doctrine. The theory
	of evolution was born beneath the pen of Lamarck,
	but immediately fell under the attacks of Cuvier.<a href="#footnote_4" id="fnm4"  class="fnmarker">4</a>
	It is to Darwin that the honour belongs of having
	rescued it from oblivion and of having initiated the
	movement which to-day rules the natural sciences.
	Studies in embryology and anatomy are rising without
	number beneath this impulse; and perhaps it
	may be said that these new sciences, so fruitful in
	results, absorb a little too much attention and leave in
	the shade subjects longer known, but which, however,
	gain new interest by the way they fit into present
	scientific theories.</p>

	<p>I wish to speak of the manners of animals; the
	<a class="pagenum" id="page7" title="7"> </a>facts regarding them are of sufficient interest if we
	consider them one by one, and they become much
	more interesting when we attempt to show the close
	way in which they are bound together. Volumes
	would not suffice to exhaust the subject; but if the
	entire task is too considerable, I may at least hope to
	accomplish a part of it by treating of those facts
	which may be brought together under the common
	title of Animal Industries. Taken separately, they
	may be reproached with a certain anecdotal character,
	but we cannot fail to agree that taken altogether they
	constitute an important chapter in the sciences of
	life.</p>

	<p><em id="ch_1_4" class="section_title">The chief industries of Man.</em> — Let us first throw
	a rapid glance at the various stages which the
	civilisation and industry of Man have gone through
	before arriving at their present condition. To make
	clear these phases we might either follow the state
	of civilisation in any given country by tracing back
	the course of centuries, or else at a given epoch
	find out in different parts of the earth all the
	stages of human evolution. The savage men of to-day
	are not further advanced in their evolution than
	our own ancestors who have now gone to fossil. However
	it may be, Man, at first frugivorous, as his
	dentition shows as well as his zoological affinities, in
	consequence of a famine of fruit or from whatever
	other cause, gradually began to nourish himself with
	the flesh of other animals. To search for this fleeing
	prey developed in him the art of hunting and fishing.
	His intelligence, still feeble, was entirely concentrated
	on this one point: to seize on an animal and to feed
	on it, although neither his nails nor his teeth nor his
	muscles make it natural to him. To hunt, to fish,
	<a class="pagenum" id="page8" title="8"> </a>to defend his territory against the wild beasts who
	attacked it and himself, to drive back tribes of
	his fellows who would diminish his provisions, these
	were the first rudiments of the industry of Man.
	Having become more skilful, he obtained in an
	expedition more game than he could consume at
	once; he then kept near him living beasts in
	order to sacrifice them when hunger came. His
	reserve of animals increased; they became accustomed
	to live near him; and he took care of
	his larder. A flock was gradually constituted, and
	the owner learnt to profit from all the resources
	which it offered him, from milk to wool. Henceforth
	he became economical with his beasts, and moved
	about in order to procure for them abundance of
	grass and water. He was still always hunting and
	fighting; but there were now accessory industries,
	and he was especially occupied in the domestication
	of animals. Then it happened that he acquired a
	taste for a graminaceous grain — corn. To seek the
	blades one by one is not a very fruitful labour, and
	decidedly troublesome. Man collected a supply of
	them, cultivated them, possessed fields which he
	sowed and harvested. He was henceforth obliged
	to renounce his herds, which had become immense;
	for he could not leave the soil where his corn was
	ripening, if he wished to gather it himself, and his
	cattle were lacking pasture. The number of beasts
	diminished; bread had killed milk. Man only kept
	near him a small flock capable of feeding on a
	moderate territory. He abandoned his temporary
	shelters, tents of skin or of woven wool, and since he
	must henceforth live on the same piece of land, he
	constructed there a fixed dwelling. Such is, taken
	<a class="pagenum" id="page9" title="9"> </a>altogether, the genesis of the industry of the dwelling
	connected with the culture of the soil; to earlier
	periods corresponded the natural or hollowed cave
	and the woven tent.</p>

	<p><em id="ch_1_5" class="section_title">The chief industries of Animals.</em> — In a more or
	less perfect degree we find the same industries
	among animals generally. In order to make just
	comparisons, we ought especially to consider the
	methods of those who are not endowed with
	specially appropriated organs, for in this case
	their task is rendered too simple. To take an
	example. The Lion is certainly an incomparable
	hunter; but his whole organisation tends to facilitate
	the capture of living prey. His agility and the
	strength of his muscles enable him to seize it at
	the first leap before it can escape. With his sharp
	claws he holds it; his teeth are so keen and his jaw
	so strong that he kills it immediately; with such
	natural advantages what need has he of ingenuity?
	But in the case of the Wolf or the Fox it is quite
	another matter; they hunt with a veritable art which
	Man himself has not disdained, since he has taken as
	his associate their relative, the Dog. It is the same
	with the Eagle and the Crow. The latter, in order to
	seize the prey which he desires, needs much more
	varied resources than the great bird of rapine for
	whom nature has done everything.</p>

	<p>We find among animals not only hunting and
	fishing but the art of storing in barns, of domesticating
	various species, of harvesting and reaping — the
	rudiments of the chief human industries. Certain
	animals in order to shelter themselves take advantage
	of natural caverns in the same way as many races of
	primitive men. Others, like the Fox and the Rodents,
	<a class="pagenum" id="page10" title="10"> </a>dig out dwellings in the earth; even to-day there are
	regions where Man does not act otherwise, preparing
	himself a lodging by excavations in the chalk or the
	tufa. Woven dwellings, constructed with materials
	entangled in one another, like the nests of birds,
	proceed from the same method of manufacture as the
	woollen stuffs of which nomad tribes make their tents.
	The Termites who construct vast dwellings of clay,
	the Beavers who build huts of wood and of mud, have
	in this industry reached the same point as Man.
	They do not build so well, no doubt, nor in so
	complex a fashion as modern architects and engineers,
	but they work in the same way. All these ingenious
	artisans operate without organs specially adapted to
	accomplish the effect which they reach. It is with
	such genuine industries that we have to deal, for the
	most part neglecting other productions, more marvellous
	in certain ways, which are formed by particular
	organs, or are elaborated within the organism, and
	are not the result of the intelligent effort of the
	individual. To this category belong the threads
	which the Spider stretches, and the cocoon with
	which the Caterpillar surrounds himself to shelter his
	metamorphosis.</p>

	<p><em id="ch_1_6" class="section_title">Intelligence and instinct.</em> — By attentive observation
	it is possible to find in animals all the intermediate
	stages between a deliberate reflective action and an
	act that has become instinctive and so inveterate to
	the species that it has re-acted on its body, and thus
	profoundly modified it so as to produce a new organ
	in such a way that the phenomena are accomplished
	as a simple function of vegetative life, in the same
	way as respiration or digestion.</p>

	<p>If an individual is led to reproduce often the same
	<a class="pagenum" id="page11" title="11"> </a>series of actions it contracts a <em>habit</em>; the repetition
	may be so frequent that the animal comes to
	accomplish it without knowing it; the brain no
	longer intervenes; the spinal cord or the chain of
	ganglia alone govern this order of acts, to which has
	been given the name of <em>reflex actions</em>. A reflex may
	be so powerful as to be transmitted by heredity to
	the descendants; it then becomes an <em>instinct</em>.</p>

	<p>Thus by its nature instinct does not differ from
	intelligence, but is intimately connected with it by a
	chain of which all the links may be counted. The most
	intelligent of beings, Man, performs actions that are
	purely mechanical; many indeed can with justice be
	called instinctive; and, on the other hand, an animal
	for whom an innate hereditary instinct is sufficient in
	ordinary life will give proof of intelligence and reflection
	if circumstances in which his instinct is
	generally efficacious become modified so that he can
	no longer profit by them. Among other ingenious
	experiments to show the supposed difference between
	instinctive and reflective acts, Fabre brings forward
	the following<a href="#footnote_5" id="fnm5"  class="fnmarker">5</a>: — The <em lang="la" xml:lang="la">Chalicodoma</em>, a hymenopterous
	relative of the Bees, constructs nests composed of cells
	formed of mud agglutinated with saliva. The cell once
	constructed, the insect begins to fill it with honey before
	laying an egg there. He returns with his booty and
	wishes to disburse himself in the nest, finds the cellule
	which he has to fill, and proceeds always in the same
	order: first, he plunges his head in the cell and disgorges
	the honey which fills his crop; secondly, he
	emerges from the cell, turns round, and lets fall the
	pollen which remains attached to his legs. Suppose
	<a class="pagenum" id="page12" title="12"> </a>that an insect has just disgorged his honey, the
	observer touches his belly with a straw; the little
	animal, disturbed in his operation, returns to it having
	only the second act to perform. But he re-commences
	the whole of his operations though having nothing
	more to disgorge; he again plunges his head into the
	cell and goes through a pretence of disgorging, then
	turns round and frees himself from the pollen.
	Although touched twice, thrice, or more frequently, he
	always repeats the first action before executing the
	second. It is, says Fabre, almost like the movement
	of a machine of which the wheelwork will not act
	until one has begun to turn the wheel which directs it.</p>

	<p>It is incontestable; but I would add, as this conscientious
	observer does not, that that does not prove
	that the intelligence of the insect differs essentially
	from ours; it is a simple question of degree. Look
	at a boy who is going to jump over a ditch: he begins
	by spitting into his hands and rubbing them one
	against the other before taking his spring. In what
	has this served him? It is not more intelligent than
	the gesture of the bee who first plunges his head in
	the cell before freeing his claws, although the first
	gesture is useless.<a href="#footnote_6" id="fnm6"  class="fnmarker">6</a></p>

	<p>And, from another side, if nothing is more instinctive
	than the manner in which domestic Bees construct
	their cells of wax with geometric regularity,
	there are other circumstances in which these same
	<a class="pagenum" id="page13" title="13"> </a>insects give proof of remarkable reflection, sagacity,
	and intelligence in co-ordinating their actions in the
	presence of an event to which they are not accustomed,
	and in attaining an end which has presented itself by
	accident. Such are, for example, the arrangements
	which they make to defend their honey against the
	attacks of a great nocturnal Moth, the Death’s Head.
	I shall have to revert to these facts.</p>

	<p>We must not then regard instinct, as has often been
	done, as a rudiment of intelligence, susceptible or not
	of development; but much rather as a series of intelligent
	acts at first reasoned, then by their frequent
	repetition become habitual, reflex, and at last, by
	heredity, instinctive.</p>

	<p>What the individual loses in individuality and in
	personal initiative, heredity restores to him in the
	form of instinct which is, as it were, the condensed
	and accumulated intelligence of his ancestors. He
	himself no longer needs to take thought either to
	preserve his life or to assure the perpetuation of his
	race. The qualities which he received at birth render
	reflection less necessary; thus species endowed with
	some powerful instinct seem not to be intelligent
	when they live sheltered from unforeseen events.</p>

	<p>From one point of view instinct appears to be a
	degradation rather than a perfecting of intelligence,
	because the acts which proceed from it are neither
	so spontaneous nor so personal; but from another
	point of view they are much better executed, with less
	hesitation, with a slighter expenditure of cerebral
	force and a minimum of muscular effort. A habitual
	act costs us much less to execute than a deliberate
	and reflective act. It is thus that the constructions of
	bees are more perfect than those of ants; the former
	<a class="pagenum" id="page14" title="14"> </a>act by instinct, the latter reason their acts at each
	step.</p>

	<p><em id="ch_1_7" class="section_title">Instinctive actions originate in reflective actions.</em> — No
	doubt it may be said: It is a pure hypothesis thus
	to consider instinct as derived from intelligence; why
	not admit as well that instinctive acts have been such
	from the beginning — in other words, that species have
	been created such as we see them to-day? The preceding
	explanation, however, has the advantage of
	being in harmony with the general theory of evolution,
	which, whether true or not, so well explains the most
	complicated facts that for the present it must be
	accepted. For the rest, if it is not possible to appraise
	the psychic faculties possessed by the ancestors of
	existing animals we may at least observe certain facts
	which put us on the road of explanation.</p>

	<p>An interesting member of the Hymenoptera, the
	<em lang="la" xml:lang="la">Sphex</em>, assures food for the early days of the life of its
	larvæ in a curious way.<a href="#footnote_7" id="fnm7"  class="fnmarker">7</a> Before laying its eggs it
	seizes a cricket, paralyses it with two strokes of its
	sting — one at the articulation of the head and the
	neck, the other at the articulation of the first ring of
	the thorax with the second — each stab traversing and
	poisoning a nervous ganglion. The cricket is paralysed
	without being killed; its flesh does not putrefy,
	and yet it makes no movement. The <em lang="la" xml:lang="la">Sphex</em> places
	an egg on this motionless prey, and the larva which
	emerges from it devours the cricket. Here assuredly
	is a marvellous and certain instinct. One cannot
	even object that the strokes of the sting are inevitably
	directed to these points because the chitinous
	envelope of the victim offers too much resistance in
	<a class="pagenum" id="page15" title="15"> </a>other spots for the dart to penetrate, because here is
	the <em lang="la" xml:lang="la">Ammophila</em>, a near relative of the <em lang="la" xml:lang="la">Sphex</em>, which
	chooses for its prey a caterpillar. It is free to introduce
	its sting into any part of the body, and yet
	with extreme certainty it strikes the two ganglions
	already mentioned.<a href="#footnote_8" id="fnm8"  class="fnmarker">8</a></p>

	<p>We cannot suppose that the insect has anatomical
	and physiological knowledge to inform it of what
	it is doing. The act is distinctly instinctive, and
	seems imprinted by a fatality involving no possible
	connection with intelligence. But let us suppose
	that the ancestors of these Hymenoptera have
	thus attacked crickets and killed (not paralysed)
	them with one or more wounds at any point.
	By chance some of these insects, either in consequence
	of their manner of attacking the prey or
	from any other cause, happen to deliver their blows
	at the points in question. Their larvæ on this
	account are placed in more favourable conditions
	than those of their relatives whom chance has less
	well served; they will prosper and develop sooner.
	They inherit this habit, which gradually becomes
	through the ages that which we know. It is possible;
	but why, it may be asked, this hypothesis,
	apparently gratuitous, of strokes of the sting given
	at random? Are there any facts which render this
	explanation plausible? Assuredly. Thus the <em lang="la" xml:lang="la">Bembex</em>,
	which especially attacks Diptera to make them
	the prey of its larvæ, throws itself suddenly on them
	and kills them with one blow in any part of the body.
	It is unable in this way to amass in advance sufficient
	provision for its larvæ; the corpses would putrefy.
	<a class="pagenum" id="page16" title="16"> </a>It is obliged to return from time to time bearing
	new pasture.<a href="#footnote_9" id="fnm9"  class="fnmarker">9</a> Again, M. Paul Marchal, taking up
	the study of instinct in the <em lang="la" xml:lang="la">Cerceris ornata</em>,<a href="#footnote_10" id="fnm10"  class="fnmarker">10</a> has
	shown that in this species at least of <em lang="la" xml:lang="la">Sphegidæ</em> the
	stings have not so considerable an effect. This
	insect attacks a wild bee, the <em lang="la" xml:lang="la">Halictus</em>. He strikes
	his victim with two or three strokes of the sting
	beneath the thorax, but the paralysis is not definite,
	perhaps on account of the nature of the venom, which
	is not identical in all species. The tortured creature
	may regain life at the end of some hours. Thus the
	<em lang="la" xml:lang="la">Cerceris</em> is obliged to destroy the upper part of the
	neck by repeated malaxation of that part for several
	minutes at a time. The effect of this second act, by
	injuring the cerebroid ganglia, is to render impossible
	the return of action; moreover, it permits the
	aggressor to satisfy personal gluttony, and to feed
	on the liquids of the organism of the vanquished,
	which is easy, because the dorsal blood-vessel passes
	at this level. It can thus satisfy a personal need
	while thinking of the future of the race.</p>

	<p>It has been said in this connection that in such
	cases the sure instinct with which these species were
	originally endowed has been distorted, but that is to
	admit some degree of variation; the hypothesis of
	degeneration is as gratuitous as the other, and if we
	go so far as to risk a hypothesis, it would be better
	to use it to explain facts and not to entangle them.</p>

	<p><em id="ch_1_8" class="section_title">Plan of study of the various industries.</em> — The
	different industries carried on by animals may be
	divided into a certain number of groups. In the case
	<a class="pagenum" id="page17" title="17"> </a>of each of these categories I propose to arrange the
	facts in such a way as to bring forward first those
	animals which, having no special organs, are obliged
	to exercise the greatest ingenuity, and then to indicate
	the facts which show how variations have arisen
	which enable other species to accomplish these acts
	with marvellous ease.</p>

	<p>We will first examine the simplest industries:
	hunting and fishing, those industries of which the
	object is the immediate search for prey; and to these
	may be added those which are related to them as
	re-action is to action — that is to say, the industries
	of which the effect is to provide for the immediate
	safety of the individual.</p>

	<p>Then in an exposition parallel to the march of
	progress followed by human civilisations, we shall
	study among animals the art of collecting provisions,
	of domesticating and exploiting flocks, of reducing
	their fellows to slavery.</p>

	<p>Finally, we shall investigate the series of modifications
	which the dwelling undergoes, and we shall
	see how certain species, after having constructed
	admirably-arranged houses, know how to make them
	healthy, and how to defend them against attacks
	from without.</p>

	HUNTING — FISHING — WARS AND EXPEDITIONS.</h2>

	<p class="chapter_contents">THE CARNIVORA MORE SKILFUL HUNTERS THAN THE

	<p><em id="ch_2_1" class="section_title">The Carnivora more skilful hunters than the Herbivora.</em> — The
	search for food has necessarily been the
	cause of the earliest industries among animals. It is
	easy to understand that the herbivora need little
	ingenuity in seeking nourishment; they are so
	superior to their prey that they can obtain it and feed
	on it by the sole fact of an organisation adapted to
	its assimilation. They are, it is true, at the mercy of
	circumstances over which they have no control, and
	which lead to famine. The carnivora also may have
	to suffer from the absence of prey, but even in the
	most favourable seasons, and in the regions where the
	animals on which they live abound, it is necessary to
	them to develop a special activity to obtain possession
	of beings who are suspicious, prompt in flight,
	<a class="pagenum" id="page19" title="19"> </a>and as fleet as themselves. Thus it is among these
	that we expect to find the art of hunting most
	cultivated; especially if we put aside the more
	grossly carnivorous of them, whose whole organisation
	is adapted for rapid and effective results.</p>

	<p><em id="ch_2_2" class="section_title">Different methods of hunting.</em> — Like Man, some
	animals hunt in ambush or by coursing; others know
	how to overturn the desired victim by throwing some
	object at it. These profit by all the exterior circumstances
	which are capable of frightening the game, of
	stunning it, and of rendering capture easy. But it is
	by studying each separate feature that we shall best
	be able to observe the close way in which these
	industries are related to our own. It is impossible to
	bring forward all the facts relating to the search for
	prey among animals; we can only take a few as signposts
	which mark the road.</p>

	<p><em id="ch_2_3" class="section_title">Hunting in ambush.</em> — The most rudimentary
	method of hunting in ambush is simply to take
	advantage of some favourable external circumstance
	to obtain concealment, and then to await the
	approach of the prey. Some animals place themselves
	behind a tuft of grass, others thrust themselves
	into a thicket, or hang on to the branch of a tree in
	order to fall suddenly on the victim who innocently
	approaches the perfidious ambush. The Crocodile, as
	described by Sir Samuel Baker, conceals himself by
	his skill in plunging noiselessly. On the bank a
	group of birds have alighted. They search the
	mud for insects or worms, or simply to approach the
	stream to drink or bathe. In spite of his great size
	and robust appetite the Crocodile does not disdain
	this slight dish; but the least noise, the least wrinkle
	on the surface of the water would cause the future
	<a class="pagenum" id="page20" title="20"> </a>repast to vanish. The reptile plunges, the birds
	continue without suspicion to come and go. Suddenly
	there emerges before them the huge open jaw armed
	with formidable teeth. In the moment of stupor and
	immobility which this unforeseen apparition produces
	a few imprudent birds have disappeared within the
	reptile’s mouth, while the others fly away. In the
	same sly and brutal manner he snaps up dogs, horses,
	oxen, and even men who come to the river to drink.</p>

	<p>One of the most dangerous ambushes which can be
	met on the road by animals who resort to a spring is
	that prepared by the Python. This gigantic snake
	hangs by his tail to the branch of a tree and lets
	himself droop down like a long creeper. The victim
	who comes within his reach is seized, enrolled,
	pounded in the knots which the snake forms around
	him. It is not necessary to multiply examples of
	this simple and widespread method of hunting.</p>

	<p>Not content with utilising the natural arrangements
	they meet with, there are animals which construct
	genuine ambushes, acting thus like Man, who builds
	in the middle or on the edge of ponds, cabins in which
	to await wild ducks, or who digs in the path of a lion
	a hole covered with trunks of trees, at the bottom of
	which he may kill the beast without danger. Certain
	insects practise this method of hunting. The Fox, for
	instance, so skilful a hunter in many respects, constructs
	an ambush when hunting hares.<a href="#footnote_11" id="fnm11"  class="fnmarker">11</a></p>

	<p>The larva of the Tiger Beetle (<em lang="la" xml:lang="la">Cicindela campestris</em>)
	constructs a hole about the size of a feather quill,
	disposed vertically, and of a depth, enormous for its
	size, of forty centimetres. It maintains itself in this
	tube by arching its supple body along the walls at a
	<a class="pagenum" id="page21" title="21"> </a>height sufficient for the top of its head to be level
	with the surface of the soil, and to close the opening
	of the hole. (<a href="#fig1" id="fig1mark">Fig. 1.</a>) A little insect — an ant, a
	young beetle, or something similar — passes. As soon
	as it begins to walk on the head of the larva, the
	latter letting go its hold of the wall allows itself to
	fall to the bottom of the trap, dragging its victim with
	it. In this narrow prison it is easily able to obtain
	the mastery over its prey, and to suck out the liquid
	parts.<a href="#footnote_12" id="fnm12"  class="fnmarker">12</a></p>

		<p class="caption"><a href="#fig1mark">Fig. 1.</a></p>
	</div>

	<p>The <em lang="la" xml:lang="la">Staphilinus Cæsareus</em> acts with still greater
	shrewdness; not only is his pit more perfect, but he
	takes care to remove all traces of preceding repasts
	which might render the place obviously one of
	carnage. He chooses a stone, beneath which he
	hollows a cylindro-conical hole with extremely
	smooth walls. This hole is not to serve as a trap,
	<a class="pagenum" id="page22" title="22"> </a>that is to say that the proprietor has no intention of
	causing any pedestrian to roll to the bottom. It is
	simply a place of concealment in which he awaits
	the propitious moment. No creature is more patient
	than this insect, and no delay discourages him. As
	soon as some small animal approaches his hiding-place
	he throws himself on it impetuously, kills
	it, and devours it. Near his ditch he has hollowed a
	second of a much coarser character, the walls of which
	have not been smoothed with the same care. One
	here sees elytra and claws piled up; they are the hard
	and horny parts which he has not been able to eat.
	The heap in this ditch is not then an alimentary store.
	It is the <em lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">oubliette</em> in which the <em lang="la" xml:lang="la">Staphilinus</em> buries the
	remains of his victims. If he allowed them to
	accumulate around his hole all pedestrians would
	come to fear this spot and to avoid it. It would be
	like the dwelling of a Polypus, which is marked by
	the numerous carapaces of crabs and shells which
	strew the neighbourhood.</p>

	<p>The ambuscade of the Ant-lion is classic; it does
	not differ greatly from the others. He excavates a
	conical pitfall, in which he conceals himself, and
	seizes the unfortunate ants and other insects whom
	ill-chance causes to roll into it.<a href="#footnote_13" id="fnm13"  class="fnmarker">13</a></p>

	<p><em id="ch_2_4" class="section_title">The baited ambush.</em> — A variety of ambush which
	brings this method of hunting to considerable perfection
	lies in inciting the prey to approach the
	hiding-place instead of trusting to chance to bring
	it there. In such circumstances Man places some
	allurement in the neighbourhood — that is to say, one
	of the foods preferred by the desired victim, or at
	<a class="pagenum" id="page23" title="23"> </a>least some object which recalls the form of that food,
	as, for example, an artificial fly to obtain possession
	of certain fishes.</p>

	<p>It is curious to find that fish themselves utilise this
	system; it is the method adopted by the Angler
	and the <em lang="la" xml:lang="la">Uranoscopus</em>.<a href="#footnote_14" id="fnm14"  class="fnmarker">14</a> The <em lang="la" xml:lang="la">Uranoscopus scaber</em> lives
	in the Mediterranean. At the end of his lower jaw
	there is developed a mobile and supple filament which
	he is able to use with the greatest dexterity. Concealed
	in the mud, without moving and only allowing
	the end of his head to emerge, he agitates and vibrates
	his filament. The little fishes who prowl in the
	neighbourhood, delighted with the sight of this
	apparent worm, regarding it as a destined prey, throw
	themselves on to it, but before they are able to bite
	and recognise their error they have disappeared in
	the mouth of the proprietor of the bait.</p>

	<p>The Angler (<em lang="la" xml:lang="la">Lophius piscatorius</em>) has not usurped
	his rather paradoxical name. He retires to the midst
	of the sea-weed and algæ. On his body and all
	round his head he bears fringed appendages which,
	by their resemblance to the leaves of marine plants,
	aid the animal to conceal himself. The colour of
	his body also does not contrast with neighbouring
	objects. From his head arise three movable filaments
	formed by three spines detached from the upper fin.
	He makes use of the anterior one, which is the longest
	and most supple. Working in the same way as the
	<em lang="la" xml:lang="la">Uranoscopus</em>, the Angler agitates his three filaments,
	giving them as much as possible the appearance of
	worms, and thus attracting the little fish on which he
	feeds.</p>

	<p>In these two examples we see a special organ
	<a class="pagenum" id="page24" title="24"> </a>utilised for a particular function; it is one of the
	intermediate cases, already referred to, between the
	true industries involving ingenuity and the simple
	phenomena due to adaptations and modifications of
	the body.</p>

	<p><em id="ch_2_5" class="section_title">Hunting in the dwelling or in the burrow.</em> — All
	these methods of hunting or of fishing by surprise are
	for the most part practised by the less agile species
	which cannot obtain their prey by superior fleetness.
	Midway between these two methods may be placed
	that which consists in surprising game when some
	circumstance has rendered it motionless. Sometimes
	it is sleep which places it at the mercy of the hunter,
	whose art in this case consists in seeking out its
	dwelling. Sometimes he profits by the youth of the
	victim, like all bird-nesters, whose aim is to eat the
	eggs or to devour the young while still incapable of
	flying. The animals who eat birds’ eggs are numerous
	both among mammals and reptiles, as well as
	among birds themselves.</p>

	<p>The Alligator of Florida and of Louisiana delights
	in this chase. He seeks in particular the Great Boat-Tail
	(<em lang="la" xml:lang="la">Quiscalus major</em>) which nests in the reeds at the
	edge of marshes and ponds. When the young have
	come out and are expecting from their parents the
	food which the chances of the hunt may delay, they
	do not cease chirping and calling by their cries. But
	the parents are not alone in hearing these appeals.
	They may also strike the ears of the alligator, who
	furtively approaches the imprudent singers. With
	a sudden stroke of his tail he strikes the reeds
	and throws into the water one or more of the
	hungry young ones, who are then at his mercy.
	(Audubon.)</p>

	<p><a class="pagenum" id="page25" title="25"> </a>The animals who feed on species living in societies
	either seize on their prey when isolated or when all
	the members of the colony are united in their city. A
	search for the nest is necessary in the case of creatures
	who are very small in comparison with the hunter, as
	in the case of ants and the Ant-eater. But the ant-eater
	possesses a very long and sticky tongue, which
	renders the capture of these insects extremely easy;
	when he finds a frequented passage it is enough to
	stretch out his tongue; all the ants come of their own
	accord and place themselves on it, and when it is
	sufficiently charged he withdraws it and devours
	them. The African <em lang="la" xml:lang="la">Orycteropus</em> (<a href="#fig2" id="fig2mark">Fig. 2</a>), who is also
	a great eater of ants and especially of termites, is
	equally aided by a very developed tongue; but he
	has less patience than the ant-eater, and he adds to
	this resource other proceedings which render the hunt
	more fruitful and enable him to obtain a very large
	number of insects at one time. Thanks to his keenness
	of scent he soon discovers an ant-path bearing
	the special and characteristic odour which these
	Hymenoptera leave behind them, and he follows the
	track which leads to their nest. On arriving there,
	without troubling himself about the scattered insects
	that prowl in the neighbourhood, he sets himself to
	penetrate into the midst of the dwelling, and with his
	strong claws hollows out a passage which enables him
	to gain access. On the way he pierces walls, breaks
	down floors, gathering here and there some fugitives,
	and arrives at last at the centre, in which millions of
	animals swarm. He then swallows them in large
	mouthfuls and retires, leaving behind him a desert
	and a ruin in the spot before occupied by a veritable
	palace, full of prodigious activity.</p>

	</div>

	<p><a class="pagenum" id="page26" title="26"> </a>The colonies are not only exposed to the devastations
	of those who feed on their members; they have
	other enemies in the animals who covet their stores
	of food. The most inveterate robber of bees is the
	nocturnal Death’s Head Moth. When he has succeeded
	in penetrating the hive the stings of the
	proprietors who throw themselves on him do not
	<a class="pagenum" id="page27" title="27"> </a>trouble him, thanks to his thick fleece of long hairs
	which the sting cannot penetrate; he makes his way
	to the cells, rips them open, gorges himself with
	honey, and causes such havoc that in Switzerland, in
	certain years when these butterflies were abundant,
	numbers of hives have been found absolutely empty.<a href="#footnote_15" id="fnm15"  class="fnmarker">15</a>
	Many other marauders and of larger size, such as the
	Bear, also spread terror among these laborious insects
	and empty their barns. No animal is more crafty
	than the Raven, and the fabulist who wished to make
	him a dupe was obliged to oppose to him the very
	cunning Fox in order to render the tale fairly life-like.
	A great number of stories are told concerning the
	Raven’s cleverness, and many of them are undoubtedly
	true. There is no bolder robber of nests. He
	swallows the eggs and eats the little ones of the
	species who cannot defend themselves against him;
	he even seeks the eggs of Sea-gulls on the coast;
	but in this case he must use cunning, for if he is discovered
	it means a serious battle. On the coast also
	the Raven seeks to obtain possession of the Hermit-crab.
	This Crustacean dwells in the empty shells of
	Gasteropods. At the least alarm he retires within
	this shell and becomes invisible, but the bird advances
	with so much precaution that he is often able to seize
	the crab before he has time to hide himself. If the
	raven fails he turns the shell over and over until the
	impatient crustacean allows a claw to emerge; he is
	then seized and immediately devoured.</p>

	<p>If there is a question of hunting larger game like a
	Hare, the Raven prefers to take an ally. They start
	him at his burrow and pursue him flying. In spite of
	his proverbial rapidity the hare is scarcely able to
	<a class="pagenum" id="page28" title="28"> </a>flee more than two hundred yards. He succumbs
	beneath vigorous blows on his skull from the beaks of
	his assailants. During winter, in the high regions of
	the Alps, when the soil is covered with snow, this
	chase is particularly fruitful for ravens. The story
	is told of that unfortunate hare who had hollowed
	out in the snow a burrow with two entrances. Two
	of these birds having recognised his presence, one
	entered one hole in order to dislodge the hare, the
	other awaited him at the other opening to batter his
	head with blows from his beak and kill him before he
	had time to gain presence of mind.<a href="#footnote_16" id="fnm16"  class="fnmarker">16</a></p>

	<p>Rooks sometimes hunt in burrows by ingeniously-concerted
	operations. Mr. Bernard<a href="#footnote_17" id="fnm17"  class="fnmarker">17</a> has described
	the interesting way in which the Rook hunts voles or
	field-mice in Thuringia. His curiosity was excited
	by the way in which numerous rooks stood about a
	field cawing loudly. In a few days this was explained:
	the field was covered with rooks; the
	original assemblage had been calling together a
	mouse-hunt, which could only be successfully carried
	out by a large number of birds acting in conjunction.
	By diligently probing the ground and blocking up
	the network of runs, the voles, one or more at a
	time, were gradually driven into a corner. The hunt
	was very successful, and no more voles were seen in
	that field during the winter.</p>

	<p><em id="ch_2_6" class="section_title">Coursing.</em> — Other animals are not easily discouraged
	by the swiftness of their prey; they count on their
	own resistance in order to tire the game; some of
	them also manage their pursuit in the most intelligent
	way, so as to preserve their own strength while the
	<a class="pagenum" id="page29" title="29"> </a>tracked animal’s strength goes on diminishing until
	exhaustion and fatigue place him at their mercy.</p>

	<p>Mammals especially, such as Dogs, Wolves, and
	Foxes, exercise this kind of chase; it is, exactly, the
	coursing which Man has merely had to direct for his
	own benefit. Wild dogs pursue their prey united in
	immense packs. They excite each other by barking
	while they frighten the game and half paralyse his
	efforts. No animal is agile and strong enough to
	be sure of escaping. They surround him and cut off
	his retreat in a most skilful manner; Gazelles and
	Antelopes, in spite of their extreme nimbleness and
	speed, are caught at last; Boars are rapidly driven
	into a corner; their vigorous defence may cost the
	life of some of the assailants, but they nevertheless
	become the prey of the band who rush on to the
	quarry. In Asia wild dogs do not fear even to
	attack the tiger. Many no doubt are crushed by a
	blow of the animal’s paw or strangled in his jaws, but
	the death of comrades does not destroy either the
	courage or the greediness of the surviving aggressors.
	Their number also is such that the great beast,
	covered by agile enemies who cling to him and
	wound him in every part, must at last succumb.</p>

	<p>Wolves hunt also in considerable bands. Their
	audacity, especially when pressed by hunger in the
	bad season, is well known. In time of war they
	follow armies, to attack stragglers and to devour the
	dead. In Siberia they pursue sledges on the snow
	with terrible perseverance, and the pack is not delayed
	by the massacre of those who are shot. A few stop
	to devour at once their fallen comrades, while the
	others continue the pursuit.</p>

	<p>Besides these brutal chases wolves seem able to
	<a class="pagenum" id="page30" title="30"> </a>exercise a genuine feint. Sometimes it is a couple
	who hunt in concert. If they meet a flock, as they
	are well aware that the dog will bravely defend the
	animals entrusted to him, that he is vigilant, and that
	his keen scent will bring him on them much sooner
	than the shepherd, it is with him that they first
	occupy themselves. The two wolves approach
	secretly; then suddenly one of them unmasks and
	attracts the attention of the dog, who rushes after
	him with such ardour that he fails to perceive that
	in the meantime the second thief has seized the
	sheep and dragged it into the wood. The dog finally
	renounces his pursuit of the fugitive and returns to
	his flock. Then the two confederates join each other
	and share the prey. In other circumstances it is a
	wolf who hunts with his female. When they wish to
	obtain possession of a deer, whose robust flight may
	last a long time, one of the couple, the male for
	example, pursues him and directs his chase in such a
	way that the game must pass by a place where the
	female wolf is concealed. She then takes up the
	chase while the male reposes. It is an organised
	system of relays. The strength of the deer becomes
	necessarily exhausted; he cannot resist the animation
	shown by his active foe, and is seized and killed.
	Then the other wolf calmly approaches the place of
	the feast to share his part of the booty.</p>

	<p>The small but bold Hawk called the Merlin also
	courses in relays in exactly the same manner. These
	birds pursue a Lark or a Swallow in the most systematic
	manner. First one Merlin chases the bird
	for a short time, while his companion hovers quietly
	at hand; then the latter relieves his fellow-hunter,
	who rests in his turn. The victim is soon tired out
	<a class="pagenum" id="page31" title="31"> </a>and caught in mid-air by one of the Merlins, who
	flies away with him, leaving his companion to hunt
	alone, while he feeds the young brood.<a href="#footnote_18" id="fnm18"  class="fnmarker">18</a></p>

	<p>The Fox also successfully uses this method of
	coursing with relays. There are indeed few animals
	who possess so many tricks of all kinds to gain
	possession of their prey. Constantly prowling about
	the fields, he neglects no propitious circumstance,
	and profits by all the advantages furnished by the
	situation of places or the habits of the game he is
	seeking. He pursues tired or wounded animals
	whom he meets, and easily masters them. If he
	finds a burrow, he quickly hollows a hole and brings
	to light the young rabbits who thought themselves
	in safety in the bowels of the earth; he robs nests
	placed in the thickets, and devours the young birds.
	Beehives are not protected against his greediness by
	the stings of the swarms; he rolls on the earth,
	crushes his assailants, and finally triumphs over the
	discouraged insects and gorges himself with honey.</p>

	</div>

	<p>Birds of prey also invent ingenious combinations
	to reach a good flier. Most of the great rapacious
	birds of rapid flight or with powerful talons are so
	well organised for the chase that they have no need
	of cunning. To see the prey, to seize it and devour
	it, are acts accomplished in a moment by the single
	fact of their natural organisation. It is rather among
	those who are less well endowed that one finds
	real art and frequent ruses. The Goshawk (<em lang="la" xml:lang="la">Astur
	palumbarius</em>, <a href="#fig3" id="fig3mark">Fig. 3</a>) is sufficiently strong and flies
	sufficiently well to seize small birds; but in order to
	obtain a copious repast at one snatch he prefers to
	<a class="pagenum" id="page33" title="33"> </a>attack pigeons. Generally the strength of their wings
	promptly places them in safety. He therefore hides
	himself in the neighbourhood of the pigeon-house,
	ready to fall on those pigeons who pick up food around.
	But the pigeons are suspicious, and if they recognise
	his presence they remain hidden in their dwellings.
	In this case it has sometimes been found that the
	Goshawk has quietly flown up to their house and
	alighted on its summit; there, by violently beating
	his wings, he gives a succession of sudden blows to
	the roof. Startled and frightened by this unaccustomed
	noise, the inhabitants dart out, and the
	bird of prey can then profit by their alarm to seize
	one or two.<a href="#footnote_19" id="fnm19"  class="fnmarker">19</a></p>

	<p>The <em lang="la" xml:lang="la">Pseudaetus</em> is also obliged to have recourse to
	a subterfuge in order to gain birds that fly well. He
	easily destroys fowls, and hunts them so successfully
	that in Spain, in certain isolated farms, it has been
	necessary to give up rearing fowls in consequence of
	these numerous depredations. But to seize pigeons
	is not so easy a matter. Generally, according to
	Jerdon, two birds unite to attack a band. One of
	the aggressors pretends to wish to seize them from
	below. This is a very unusual method, for birds of
	prey always rise above the game in order to throw
	themselves down on it. This puts out the pigeons,
	and they fear the manœuvre all the more because
	they are unaccustomed to it. During this instant of
	confusion the second assailant passes unperceived
	above them, plunges into the midst and seizes a
	pigeon; there is a new panic, by which the first
	aggressor profits in order to rise rapidly in his turn
	and seize a second victim.</p>

	<p><a class="pagenum" id="page34" title="34"> </a><em id="ch_2_7" class="section_title">Struggles that terminate the hunt.</em> — It is not always
	sufficient for the hunter to find game and to reach it.
	If the game is of large size it may be able to hold its
	own, and the pursuit may end in a violent struggle,
	in which both skill and cunning are necessary to
	obtain conquest.</p>

	<p>The Bald Eagle of North America (<em lang="la" xml:lang="la">Haliäetus leucocephalus</em>)
	hides himself on a rock by the edge of a
	stream and awaits the passing of a swan. This eagle
	is brave and strong, but the palmiped is vigorous, and
	though inferior in the air, he has an advantage on
	the water, and may escape death by plunging. The
	eagle knows this advantage, so he compels the swan
	to remain in the air by attacking him from below
	and repeatedly striking his belly. Weakened by
	the flow of blood, and obliged to fly, not being
	able to reach the water without finding the sharp
	beak which strikes him, the swan succumbs in this
	unequal combat, which has been vividly described
	by Audubon.</p>

		<p class="caption"><a href="#fig4mark">Fig. 4.</a></p>
	</div>

	<p>The bird who displays the most remarkable qualities
	in this struggle which terminates the chase, exhibiting
	indeed a real fencing match, is the Secretary Bird
	(<em lang="la" xml:lang="la">Gypogeranus reptilivorus</em>. <a href="#fig4" id="fig4mark">Fig. 4.</a>) He is the
	more interested in striking without being himself
	struck since the fangs with which his prey, the
	snake, is generally armed might at the first blow give
	him a mortal wound. In South Africa he pursues
	every snake, even the most venomous. Warned by
	instinct of the terrible enemy he has met, the reptile
	at first seeks safety in flight; the Secretary follows
	him on foot, and the ardour of the chase does not
	prevent him from being constantly on guard. This
	is because the snake, finding himself nearly overtaken,
	<a class="pagenum" id="page35" title="35"> </a>suddenly turns round, ready to use his
	defensive weapons. The bird stops, and turns in
	one of his wings to protect the lower parts of his
	body. A real duel then begins. The snake throws
	himself on his enemy, who at each stroke parries
	with the end of his wing; the fangs are buried in
	the great feathers which terminate it, and there leave
	their poison without producing any effect. All this
	time with the other wing the Secretary repeatedly
	strikes the reptile, who is at last stunned, and rolls
	<a class="pagenum" id="page36" title="36"> </a>over on the earth. The conqueror rapidly thrusts
	his beak into his skull, throws his victim into the
	air, and swallows him.<a href="#footnote_20" id="fnm20"  class="fnmarker">20</a></p>

	<p><em id="ch_2_8" class="section_title">Hunting with projectiles.</em> — It has often been repeated
	that Man is the only creature sufficiently
	intelligent to utilise as weapons exterior objects like
	a stone or a stick; in a much greater degree, therefore,
	it was said, was he the only creature capable of
	striking from afar with a projectile. Nevertheless
	creatures so inferior as fish exhibit extreme skill in
	the art of reaching their prey at a distance. Several
	act in this way. There is first the <em lang="la" xml:lang="la">Toxotes jaculator</em>,
	who lives in the rivers of India. His principal food
	is formed by the insects who wander over the leaves
	of aquatic plants. To wait until they fell into the
	water would naturally result in but meagre fare. To
	leap at them with one bound is difficult, not to
	mention that the noise would cause them to flee.
	The <em lang="la" xml:lang="la">Toxotes</em> knows a better trick than that. He
	draws in some drops of water, and, contracting his
	mouth, projects them with so much force and certainty
	that they rarely fail to reach the chosen aim,
	and to bring into the water all the insects he desires.<a href="#footnote_21" id="fnm21"  class="fnmarker">21</a>
	(<a href="#fig5" id="fig5mark">Fig. 5.</a>) Other animals also squirt various liquids,
	sometimes in attack, but more especially in defence.
	The Cephalopods, for example, emit their ink, which
	darkens the water and allows them to flee. Certain
	insects exude bitter or fœtid liquids; but in all
	these cases, and in others that are similar, the
	<a class="pagenum" id="page38" title="38"> </a>animal finds in his own organism a secretion which
	happens to be more or less useful to his conservation.
	The method of the <em lang="la" xml:lang="la">Toxotes</em> is different. It is a
	foreign body which he takes up, and it is an intended
	victim at which he takes aim and which he strikes;
	his movements are admirably co-ordinated to obtain
	a precise effect.</p>

	<div id="fig5" class="figcenter"><a class="pagenum disguise" id="page37" title="37"> </a>

		<p class="caption"><a href="#fig5mark">Fig. 5.</a></p>
	</div>

	<p>Another fish, the <em lang="la" xml:lang="la">Chelinous</em> of Java, also acts in
	this manner. He generally lives in estuaries. It is
	therefore a brackish water which he takes up and
	projects by closing his gills and contracting his
	mouth; he can thus strike a fly at a distance of
	several feet. Usually he aims sufficiently well to
	strike it at the first blow, but sometimes he fails.
	Then he begins again until he has succeeded, which
	shows that his movements are not those of a machine.
	He knows what he is doing, what effect ought to be
	produced, and whether this desired result has happened,
	and he perseveres until the insect has fallen.
	These facts are unquestioned; the Chinese preserve
	these curious fish in jars, and amuse themselves by
	making them carry on this little exercise. Many
	observers have witnessed and described it.</p>

	<p><em id="ch_2_9" class="section_title">Particular circumstances put to profit.</em> — In the
	various kinds of hunting which we have been passing
	in review, it is certain that the animals in question
	generally exercise them nearly always in the same
	manner. If an animal has carried out a ruse successfully
	he does not abandon it, but reproduces it as
	often as it is efficacious. When, however, conditions
	happen to change, animals are prompt to profit by
	them, and one sees how all these acts are derived
	from reflection. This is the clearer the more the
	favourable circumstance is accidental and unforeseen,
	<a class="pagenum" id="page39" title="39"> </a>when it is not possible to consider the animals as
	accustomed to profit by it.</p>

	<p>In the wild regions of Africa it happens that from
	some reason or another, perhaps from the effect of
	lightning on immense forests, dense thickets or plains
	covered by tall plants become the prey of gigantic
	fires which spread as long as they find food on their
	road. The heat as of a furnace arises above and
	around; an acrid smoke veils everything, and the
	frightened animals flee before the scourge. Travellers
	who have witnessed these magnificent scenes often
	insist on the panics thus produced, and describe the
	inoffensive lion fleeing in the midst of a herd of
	gazelles. All are seized by the same fear, because all
	are exposed to the same danger. But birds, whose
	wings can carry them at will afar from the furnace,
	preserve greater presence of mind, and profit by the
	public calamity and general anxiety to make a
	successful hunt and copious feasts. One may see the
	birds of prey flying in front of the fire and seizing
	easy victims. Certain birds of Africa are the most
	furious hunters during a fire. Legions of insects
	flee far from the tall dried plants, and clouds of
	birds arrive to throw themselves on them. They
	pursue them with incredible audacity through the
	smoke close to the flames and always retire in time
	to avoid singeing. A member of the Crow family
	who inhabits India, <em lang="la" xml:lang="la">Anomalocorax splendens</em>, enjoys
	a deserved reputation of astuteness and allows no
	opportunity to escape without seizing it by the
	forelock. In ordinary times his food is composed of
	very varied substances — crabs, insects, worms, etc.;
	but if he perceives afar an ascending cloud he
	immediately abandons his small researches, knowing
	<a class="pagenum" id="page40" title="40"> </a>there is something better to be done over there. He
	is not selfish, and he calls a few comrades and they all
	put themselves into position to await events. They
	know very well the relation that exists between this
	smoke and the prey they covet. The fire indicated
	by the smoke can have no other reason in this hot
	country than the cooking of food. A Hindoo family
	are in fact installed and preparing their repast. The
	birds see all this and observe. The Hindoos are
	accustomed to throw outside the remains of their
	meals, and the <em lang="la" xml:lang="la">Anomalocorax</em>, who have come together
	from afar to await patiently this result, then throw
	themselves on the quarry. (Jerdon.)</p>

	<p>Tennent narrates a singular trick which was twice,
	to his knowledge, played on a dog by two of these
	small glossy crows of Ceylon. The dog was gnawing a
	bone and would not be disturbed from the pure delight
	of sucking the marrow of which he was the legitimate
	proprietor. A crow approached the scene of the
	feast, and conceived the design of taking possession
	of it; he began by hopping around the dog, going
	and coming, trying to attract the animal’s attention
	and ready to profit by the first distraction. His
	gambols remaining without result, he understood that
	he would not succeed and he flew away; but it was
	only to return accompanied by a friend possessing as
	little respect as himself for the property of others.
	The associate perched on a branch a few steps away,
	while the first crow renewed his attempts by flying
	around the bone and the dog; but the latter remained
	impassive. Then the second personage, whose part
	had hitherto been to remain contemplative, flew off
	his branch, threw himself on the dog and gave him a
	formidable blow on the spine. Seized with indignation,
	<a class="pagenum" id="page41" title="41"> </a>the dog turned round to punish the author of
	this unjustifiable aggression; but the bird was already
	far away, and in the meanwhile from the other side
	the first <em lang="la" xml:lang="la">Anomalocorax</em> seized the long-coveted bone
	and also took flight. The feelings of the sheepish
	dog who saw both his vengeance and his repast flying
	away in the air may be better imagined than
	described.<a href="#footnote_22" id="fnm22"  class="fnmarker">22</a></p>

	<p>All the birds, indeed, of this family know how to
	reach their ends. I have already spoken of certain
	hunts of the Raven; it is even said that in Iceland he
	knows when a ewe is going to give birth to young,
	and awaits this moment with immense patience. As
	soon as the lamb appears the Raven alights on him,
	digs out his eyes, and devours them.</p>

	<p>The Quelelis or Guadaloupe Caracara (<em lang="la" xml:lang="la">Polyborus
	lutosus</em>), a Californian bird of prey, is a cruel enemy
	to animals like the goat when they are about to bring
	forth their young. No sooner is one kid born, and
	while the mother is yet in labour with the second,
	than the birds pounce upon it, and should the mother
	be able to interfere, she is assaulted also. If there are
	a number of young kids together, the birds unite their
	forces and with great noise and flapping of wings
	succeed in separating the weakest and killing it.<a href="#footnote_23" id="fnm23"  class="fnmarker">23</a></p>

	<p>Dr. J. Lowe has recently called attention to a very
	curious method of attracting prey adopted by the
	Blackcap (<em lang="la" xml:lang="la">Sylvia atricapilla</em>) at Orotava, Teneriffe.<a href="#footnote_24" id="fnm24"  class="fnmarker">24</a>
	This bird has discovered that the juice exuded by
	certain flowers (<em lang="la" xml:lang="la">Hibiscus Rosa sinensis</em> and <em lang="la" xml:lang="la">Abutilon
	frondosum</em>) is attractive to the insects upon which
	<a class="pagenum" id="page42" title="42"> </a>he preys; he therefore punctures the petals of these
	flowers in order to promote the exudation of this
	viscid secretion.</p>

	<p>Many of us in our schooldays have admired the
	intelligence of Jackdaws having their nests in some
	old tower or belfry. They are able to distinguish
	according to the hour the significance of the various
	school bells. Most of these clangs do not move them,
	and they continue to attend to their affairs without
	paying attention. Their attention is only attracted
	by the ringing which marks the beginning and the end
	of recreation time. At the sound of the first they all
	flee and abandon the courts before even a single pupil
	has yet appeared. The bell, on the contrary, which
	marks the end of recreation time invites them to
	descend in a band to collect the crumbs of lunch.
	They arrive in a hurry, so as to be the first to profit
	by the repast, not waiting even until the place is
	abandoned; they know very well that the young
	people still there are not to be feared, having no time
	now to be occupied with them.</p>

	<p>In this class of facts, there are a certain number
	which may be considered as more marked by custom
	and perhaps less marked by spontaneous reflection.
	Such, for example, is the custom of Sharks and Seagulls
	to follow ships.</p>

	<p>In the seas where Dog-fish are abundant, one or
	more of them become attached to a ship, and quit it
	neither night nor day. One may believe sometimes
	that they are not there; but if any object is thrown
	into the sea, the fin of one of these monsters appears
	at the surface; everything which is thrown overboard
	disappears in their large jaws — kitchen refuse, bottles,
	etc. When a dead body is thrown into the sea it
	<a class="pagenum" id="page43" title="43"> </a>is soon seized by the shark, while living men who
	fall into the water have great difficulty in escaping,
	and are often drawn up horribly mutilated and half
	dead.</p>

	<p>Sea-gulls also follow vessels when they approach
	the coast. It is a pleasant sight to see the noisy band
	animating the monotonous splendour of the ocean;
	they arrive as soon as a vessel is one or two days’
	journey from land. Henceforth they do not leave
	her, flying behind and plunging in her wake; they
	profit by the disturbance produced by the gigantic
	machine to capture the stunned fishes.</p>

	<p>On land exactly the same kind of chase is carried
	on by Rooks, Crows, and Magpies, who follow the
	plough to seize the worms which the ploughshare
	turns up in the open earth. In autumn they cover
	the fields, animated and active, pilfering as the furrow
	is hollowed out.</p>

	<p>Certain rapacious birds who are awkward in
	hunting, especially Kites, make up for their lack of
	skill by audacious impudence. Constantly on the
	watch for better hunters like the Falcon, they throw
	themselves on him as soon as he has seized his prey.
	The proud bird, though much more courageous,
	stronger, and more skilful than these thieves, usually
	abandons the prey either because the burden embarrasses
	him in the struggle, or else because he knows
	that he can easily find another. These highway robbers
	of the air often unite to gain possession of a prey
	already taken and killed, and ready to be eaten. A
	handsome Falcon of the Southern States of North
	America, the Caracara Eagle (<em lang="la" xml:lang="la">Polyborus cheriway</em>),
	frequently steals fish from the Brown Pelicans on the
	coast of Texas. When the Pelicans are returning
	<a class="pagenum" id="page44" title="44"> </a>from their expeditions with pouches filled with fish,
	the Caracaras attack them until they disgorge, and
	then alight to devour the stolen prey. They do not
	attack the outgoing birds, but only the incoming
	ones, and they wait until they reach the land (so that
	the contents of the pouches may not fall into the
	water) before pouncing on them.<a href="#footnote_25" id="fnm25"  class="fnmarker">25</a></p>

	<p>Among other animals a habit has been formed from
	some special circumstance. As an extreme case in
	this group we meet with parasites of whom some
	cannot live outside a particular nest, and are even
	absolutely transformed by this kind of life. But
	between these and independent hunters there are
	an extreme number of intermediate stages, of which
	it is sufficient to mention a few.<a href="#footnote_26" id="fnm26"  class="fnmarker">26</a></p>

	<p>The <em lang="la" xml:lang="la">Fierasfer</em>, a little fish of the Mediterranean,
	installs himself in the respiratory cavity of a Holothurian;
	he does not live at the expense of his host’s
	flesh, but contents himself with levying a tax on the
	foods which enter the cavity. It is a case of commensalism
	of which there are very numerous examples.
	Other cases may be mentioned which are
	still further removed from parasitism. Among these
	may be mentioned the birds who relieve large
	mammals of their vermin.</p>

	<p>One of them, the Red-beaked Buffalo bird (<em lang="la" xml:lang="la">Buphaga
	erythrorhyncha</em>), lives in Abyssinia. This bird is insectivorous.
	He has remarked that the ruminants
	constitute baits for flies; therefore he never leaves
	these animals, hops about on their backs and delivers
	them from annoying parasites; the buffaloes, who
	<a class="pagenum" id="page45" title="45"> </a>recognise this service, allow the bird to wander
	quietly over their hide. The <em lang="la" xml:lang="la">Buphaga</em>, who gives himself
	up entirely to this kind of chase, is often called the
	Beef-eater. He is only found in the society of flocks,
	of camels, buffaloes, or oxen. He settles on the back,
	legs, and snouts of these living baits. They remain
	passive even when he opens the skin in order to draw
	out the flies’ larva; they know the benefit of this little
	operation. The patience of the oxen is certainly due
	to custom, for it is observed that herds which are not
	used to this bird manifest great terror when he
	prepares to alight on them, so that they even take
	flight from this small aggressor.</p>

	<p>Sometimes it is not easy to understand the advantages
	derived by the animal from the conditions in
	which he is usually found. Thus, for example, there
	is a fish, the <em lang="la" xml:lang="la">Polyprion cernium</em>, which accompanies
	driftwood on which Barnacles have fixed themselves.
	Yet the remains of these Crustaceans are never found
	in his stomach, and it is known on the contrary that
	he lives exclusively on other small fish. It is possible
	that these find their food in fragments of wood at the
	expense of the barnacles, and that therefore the <em lang="la" xml:lang="la">Polyprion</em>
	which hunts them is always near driftwood thus
	garnished.</p>

	<p><em id="ch_2_10" class="section_title">Methods of utilising the captured game.</em> — Frequently
	it is not enough for the animal to obtain possession
	of his prey. Before making his meal it is still
	necessary to find a method of making use of it, either
	because the eatable parts are buried in a thick shell
	which he is unable to break, or because he has captured
	a creature which rolls itself into a ball and bristles its
	plumes. Here are some of the more curious practices
	followed in such cases.</p>

	<p><a class="pagenum" id="page46" title="46"> </a>Sometimes it is a question of carrying off a round
	fruit which offers no prominence to take hold of. The
	Red-headed Melanerpes (<em lang="la" xml:lang="la">Melanerpes erythrocephalus</em>)
	of North America is very greedy with regard to apples,
	and feeds on them as well as on cherries. It takes
	him a considerable time to consume an apple, and as
	he is well aware of the danger he runs by prolonging
	his stay in an orchard, he wishes to carry away his
	booty to a safe and sheltered spot. He vigorously
	plunges his open beak into the apple; the two mandibles
	enter separately, and the fruit is well fixed; he
	detaches it and flies away to the chosen retreat. Apes
	are very skilful in utilising their booty. Cocoa-nuts
	are rather hard to open, but Apes do not lose any part
	of them; they first tear off the fibrous envelope with
	their teeth, then they enlarge the natural holes with
	their fingers, and drink the milk. Finally, in order to
	reach the kernel they strike the nut on some hard
	object exactly as Man would do. The Baboons (<em lang="la" xml:lang="la">Cynocephali</em>),
	whose courage is prodigious, since they will
	fight in a band against a pack of dogs or even against
	a leopard, are also very prudent and very skilful.
	They know that courage is no use against the sting
	of a venomous snake, and that the best thing is to
	avoid being bitten. The scorpion, whose dart is perfidious,
	also inspires their distrust, but as they like
	eating him they endeavour to catch him. This is not
	indeed very difficult if one carefully observes his
	movements, and it is possible to seize him suddenly
	by the tail, as I have often done, without being stung.
	Apes employ this method, pull out his sting, and
	crunch the now inoffensive Arachnid. They also like
	ants, but fear being bitten by them; when they wish
	to enjoy them, they place an open hand on an ant-hill
	<a class="pagenum" id="page47" title="47"> </a>and remain motionless until it is covered by insects.
	They can then absorb them at one stroke without
	fear.</p>

	<p>One would not think that an animal so well defended
	as the Hedgehog need fear becoming the prey
	of the Fox. Rolled in a ball, bristling with hard
	prickles which cruelly wound an assailant’s mouth,
	nothing will induce him to unroll so long as he
	supposes the enemy still in the neighbourhood. It is
	vain to strike him or to rub him on the earth; he
	remains on the armed defensive. Only one circumstance
	disturbs him to the point of making him quit
	his prudent posture; it is to feel himself in the water,
	or even simply to be moist. The fox is acquainted
	with this weakness, therefore as soon as he has
	captured a hedgehog he rolls him in the nearest
	marsh to strangle him as soon as his head appears.
	It may happen that there is no puddle in the neighbourhood
	suitable for this bath; it is said that in this
	case the fox is not embarrassed for so small a matter,
	and provides from his own body the wherewithal to
	moisten the hedgehog.</p>

	<p>The combination is complicated, and approaches
	more nearly the methods employed by Man when the
	animal makes use of a foreign body, as a tool or as
	a fulcrum, to achieve his objects. A snake is very
	embarrassed when he has swallowed an entire egg
	with the shell; he cannot digest it in that condition,
	and the muscles of his stomach are not strong enough
	to break it. The snake often finds himself in this condition,
	and is then accustomed either to strike his body
	against hard objects or to coil himself around them
	until he has broken the envelope of the eggs he
	contains.</p>

	<p><a class="pagenum" id="page48" title="48"> </a>The Snake himself is treated in this way in South
	America. The Sulphur Tyrant-bird picks up a young
	snake by the tail, and, flying to a branch or stone,
	uses it like a flail until its life is battered out.<a href="#footnote_27" id="fnm27"  class="fnmarker">27</a></p>

	<p>It would be a paradox to attribute great intelligence
	to Batrachians; yet certain facts are recorded which
	show them to be capable of reflection. Among others
	the case is quoted of a green frog who obtained possession
	of a small red frog, and who proposed to
	swallow him. The other was naturally opposed to
	the realisation of this scheme and struggled with
	energy. Seeing that he would not succeed, the green
	frog went towards the trunk of a tree and, still
	holding his victim, struck him many times vigorously
	against it. At last the red frog was stunned, and
	could then be swallowed at leisure.</p>

	<p>Gasteropods are not always protected by their calcareous
	shells any more than tortoises are by their
	carapaces; for certain birds know very well how
	to break them. Ravens drop snails from a height,
	and thus get possession of the contents of the
	shell.</p>

	<p>The most celebrated breaker of shells is the
	Bearded Vulture or Lammergeyer (<em lang="la" xml:lang="la">Gypäetos barbatus</em>).
	This rapacious bird is very common in Greece, where
	he does not usually live on large prey. If he sometimes
	carries away a fowl, it is exceptional; he prefers
	to live on carrion or bones, the remains of the feasts
	of man or of the true vulture. He rises very high
	carrying these bones in his talons and allows them to
	fall on a stone, swallowing the fragments after having
	sucked out the marrow. He is also greedy of tortoises,
	and uses the same method to break their
	<a class="pagenum" id="page49" title="49"> </a>carapaces, eating the soft parts. These facts have
	been many times observed by Brehm and other trustworthy
	naturalists. It is even said that in Greece
	every Lammergeyer chooses a rock on which he
	always comes to execute the tortoises he has captured.
	It was no doubt beneath one of these birds so occupied
	that, according to the story, mischance conducted
	Æschylus.</p>

	<p>Neither the beak nor the claws of the Shrike or
	Butcher-bird (<em lang="la" xml:lang="la">Lanius excubitor</em>) are strong enough to
	enable him to tear his prey easily. When he is not
	too driven by hunger he installs himself in a comfortable
	fashion for this carving process, places on a
	thorn or on a pointed branch the victim he has made,
	and when it is thus fixed easily devours it in threads.</p>

	<p>The <em lang="la" xml:lang="la">Lanius collurio</em>, an allied bird, uses this method
	still more frequently. He even prepares a small
	larder before feasting. One may thus see on a thorny
	branch spitted side by side Coleoptera, crickets, grasshoppers,
	frogs, and even young birds, which he has
	seized when they were in flight.<a href="#footnote_28" id="fnm28"  class="fnmarker">28</a> (<a href="#fig6" id="fig6mark">Fig. 6.</a>)</p>

	</div>

	<p>Of all these well-attested facts that which perhaps
	best shows how animals in certain circumstances may
	take advantage of a foreign body to utilise the product
	of the chase, is the following, the observation of
	which is due to Parseval-Deschênes.<a href="#footnote_29" id="fnm29"  class="fnmarker">29</a> He followed
	during several hours an ant bearing a heavy burden.
	On arriving at the foot of a little hillock the animal
	was unable to mount with his load, and abandoned
	it — a very extraordinary fact for one who knows the
	<a class="pagenum" id="page51" title="51"> </a>inconceivable tenacity of insects. The abandonment
	therefore left hope of return. The ant at last met
	one of his companions, who was also carrying a
	burden. They stopped, took counsel for an instant,
	bringing their antennæ together, and started for the
	hillock. The second ant then left his burden, and
	both together then seized a twig and introduced its
	end beneath the first load which had been abandoned
	because of its weight. By acting on the free extremity
	of the twig they were able to use it exactly
	as a lever, and succeeded almost without trouble in
	passing their booty on to the other side of the little
	hillock. It seems to me that these ants who invented
	the lever are worthy of admiration, and that their
	ingenuity does not yield to our own.</p>

	<p>I will, finally, give an example of the methods of
	surmounting a difficulty of another order in utilising
	captured prey. It is not enough to capture prey, or
	even to possess the means of utilising the prey when
	captured. It is sometimes also necessary to prevent
	the booty being taken possession of by some other
	member of the same species as the hunter. Spiders
	are specially liable to this danger, because their victims
	are noisy when caught. Hudson has described an
	ingenious device made use of by a species of <em lang="la" xml:lang="la">Pholcus</em> — a
	quiet inoffensive Spider found in Buenos Ayres — to
	escape this risk. This spider, though large, is a
	weak creature, and possesses little venom to despatch
	a fly quickly. The task of killing it is therefore long
	and laborious, and the loud outcries of the victim
	may be heard for a long time, sometimes for ten or
	twelve minutes. The other spiders in the vicinity are
	naturally excited by this noise, and hurry out from
	their webs to the scene of conflict, and the strongest
	<a class="pagenum" id="page52" title="52"> </a>or most daring sometimes succeeds in carrying away
	the fly from its rightful captor. Where, however, a
	large colony have been long in undisturbed possession
	of a ceiling, when one has caught a fly he rapidly
	throws a covering of web over it, cuts it away, and
	drops it down to hang suspended by a line at a
	distance of two or three feet from the ceiling. The
	other spiders arrive on the scene, but not finding the
	cause of the disturbance retire to their own webs
	again. When the coast is thus clear, our spider
	proceeds to draw up the captive fly, now exhausted
	by its struggles.<a href="#footnote_30" id="fnm30"  class="fnmarker">30</a></p>

	<p><em id="ch_2_11" class="section_title">War and brigandage.</em> — When Man attacks animals
	of another species, either to kill them and feed on their
	flesh, or to steal the provisions which they have
	amassed for themselves or their young, this is called
	“hunting,” and is considered as perfectly legitimate.
	When men turn to beings of their own species either
	to kill them or to rob them, several different cases are
	distinguished. If the assailants are few in number, it
	is called “brigandage,” and is altogether reprehensible;
	but if both assailant and assailed are considerable in
	number, the action is called “war,” and receives no
	reprobation.</p>

	<p>There are hunters among animals as well as among
	ourselves, and we have seen their various methods of
	procedure; but there are also brigands and warriors,
	and our superiority even in this department is not so
	absolute as might be imagined.</p>

	<p>Independently of ordinary brigandage, which is a
	brutal and simple form of the struggle for life, manifested
	every time the animals find themselves before
	a single repast, there are interesting facts to be noted
	<a class="pagenum" id="page53" title="53"> </a>concerning robbers who act in a manner that Man
	himself would not disavow. It is worthy of remark
	that it is the most sociable animals who furnish us
	with the most characteristic examples.</p>

	<p>Bees have a just renown as honest and laborious
	insects; there are, however, some who depart from
	the right road, and they do not do it by halves.<a href="#footnote_31" id="fnm31"  class="fnmarker">31</a>
	Among Hymenoptera the lazy profess the theory
	that pollen belongs to all bees, and that stored-up
	honey does not constitute private property. Therefore,
	to protest against work and economy, sly
	methods are employed by a few to utilise as their own
	private property the resources which Nature has made
	for all; they adopt the plan of plundering the working
	insects, and carrying away for themselves the pollen
	which the others had had the audacity to seek among
	the flowers.</p>

	<p>To arrive at these ends these clever Hymenoptera
	employ cunning, and endeavour to pose as workers.
	They place themselves at the approaches to a hive,
	and when a worker arrives laden with its burden they
	advance towards it, caress it with their antennæ, take
	possession of its pollen as if to relieve it of a burden,
	and then fly away to their own hive.</p>

	<p>Others adopt less diplomatic proceedings. Some
	unite to intrude in a badly-guarded hive, and gorge
	themselves with the honey to which they have no
	right. Following up this success, they bring accomplices;
	a veritable band of brigands is organised, who
	have no other industry than to seize honey already
	manufactured in order to fill their own cells. Their
	audacious enterprises are not always crowned with
	success; they are repulsed in populous and well-organised
	<a class="pagenum" id="page54" title="54"> </a>hives, but they are successful in the weaker
	ones. Sometimes they act with violence, and to
	reduce a swarm they first fall on the queen and kill
	her with their stings. Disconcerted by her death,
	the bees allow the pillage of their dwelling, and the
	cells are robbed from top to bottom. In some cases
	the deprived proprietors, in their turn carried away
	by this insanity of rapine, even go over themselves to
	the assailing party, and carry their own honey to the
	house of the bandits. Henceforth they unite their
	fortune to that of the others, and share in their easy
	and adventurous life.<a href="#footnote_32" id="fnm32"  class="fnmarker">32</a></p>

	<p>Bates has given a vivid description of the armies
	of the South American Foraging Ants (<em lang="la" xml:lang="la">Eciton</em>).
	They are carnivorous hunters who march in large
	armies, and are found on the banks of the Amazon,
	especially in the open campos of Santarem. The
	<em lang="la" xml:lang="la">Eciton legionis</em> chiefly carry off the mangled larvæ
	and pupæ of other ants. They will attack the nests
	of a bulky species of the genus <em lang="la" xml:lang="la">Formica</em>; they lift out
	the bodies of these ants and tear them in pieces, as
	they are too large for a single <em lang="la" xml:lang="la">Eciton</em> to carry off,
	a number of carriers seizing each fragment. They
	seem to divide into parties, one party excavating
	and the other carrying away the grains of earth to
	a distance from the hole just sufficient to prevent
	them rolling back into it. There is, however, no
	rigid distribution of labour, the miners sometimes
	becoming carriers, and then again assuming the
	office of carrying off the prey. In marching off
	they form a broad and compact column, sixty or
	seventy yards in length, those who may be empty-handed
	<a class="pagenum" id="page55" title="55"> </a>assisting heavily-laden comrades. The <em lang="la" xml:lang="la">Eciton
	drepanophora</em> attacks and carries off all kinds of
	insects, especially wingless species, such as maggots,
	caterpillars, larvæ of cockroaches, etc. An eyeless
	species,<a href="#footnote_33" id="fnm33"  class="fnmarker">33</a> the <em lang="la" xml:lang="la">Eciton erratica</em>, rapidly forms covered
	passages under which to advance, and shows great
	skill in fitting the keystone to these convex arcades.<a href="#footnote_34" id="fnm34"  class="fnmarker">34</a></p>

	<p>Belt has also made some extremely interesting
	observations on the <em lang="la" xml:lang="la">Ecitons</em>, whom for intelligence he
	places first among the ants of Central America, and
	as such at the head of the Articulata.<a href="#footnote_35" id="fnm35"  class="fnmarker">35</a></p>

	<p><em id="ch_2_12" class="section_title">Expeditions to acquire slaves.</em> — In order to reduce
	one’s own species to slavery, it seems at first that an
	intelligence is required as developed as that of Man.
	It is necessary in fact to attack beings nearly equally
	well endowed from an intellectual and physical
	point of view. The enterprise evidently presents
	every possible difficulty; but in case of success,
	the result more than compensates for the effort. The
	master in future need not trouble to work, for he
	possesses a tool capable of doing everything as well as
	himself, since by means of language he can easily
	impress his will on the acts of the other; a domestic
	animal is only an auxiliary, the slave entirely replaces
	his owner in every labour.</p>

	<p>Several species of ants thus obtain slaves. The
	best known of these is the <em lang="la" xml:lang="la">Polyergus rufescens</em>. We
	shall see in another chapter in what way they take
	advantage of slaves, and what relations they have with
	<a class="pagenum" id="page56" title="56"> </a>them. At present it is only necessary to say how
	the slaves are obtained. The expeditions organised
	for this purpose are simply a perfected chase, both
	by the way in which they are conducted, and by
	the result to which they are to lead. It is not a
	question of brutally seizing a prey to be devoured
	immediately. The captured animal must be carefully
	managed, carried away alive and in such a condition
	that it has not yet known a free life, and can accustom
	itself to new conditions. When the <em lang="la" xml:lang="la">Polyergus</em> or
	Amazon ants desire to increase their band of slaves,
	one first remarks extreme excitement in the neighbourhood
	of the nest. They all come out helter-skelter,
	but this disorder lasts only for a short time;
	they soon form in line, and a regular serried column
	is formed, longer or shorter according to the swarm;
	it has been found to measure more than five metres
	long by fifteen centimetres broad. The Amazons
	advance, often changing their direction like a dog who
	is seeking a scent: this is exactly what they are
	doing, they smell the ground with their antennæ in
	order to recognise traces of the <em lang="la" xml:lang="la">Formica fusca</em>. In
	this march the eminently republican instinct of the
	ants comes out. The band has no chief; those who
	are at the head go forward smelling the ground; this
	slackens their pace, so that they are passed by those
	in the ranks behind. Little by little they fall into
	single file, and this continuing during the whole course
	of the march, a particular ant may sometimes be at
	the head of the column, sometimes in the middle,
	sometimes in the rear. At the end of a longer or
	shorter period the expedition discovers a scent, which
	it follows up to the nest of the <em lang="la" xml:lang="la">Formica fusca</em>. The
	alarm is immediately given in the threatened ant-hill;
	<a class="pagenum" id="page57" title="57"> </a>the approach is announced of a band of slavers, and
	they all rush out, some to face their terrible adversaries
	while the others take up the nymphs and eggs in their
	mandibles and flee in all directions to save as many as
	possible of their offspring. The small ants endeavour
	with their burdens to climb to the summits of blades
	of grass; those who succeed are in safety with the
	eggs that they carry, for the Amazons do not climb.
	In the meanwhile a fierce battle is going on in the
	neighbourhood of the nest between the <em lang="la" xml:lang="la">Formica fusca</em>,
	who have made a sortie, and the slavers. It is an
	unequal struggle, because the latter are armed with
	formidable jaws, strong and sharp, borne by a large
	head with powerful muscles. The defenders of the
	nest are seized and placed <em lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">hors de combat</em>. They flee
	discouraged, and the assailants force the entry of the
	dwelling. They then take possession of the larvæ
	and nymphs and come out again holding them in
	their mandibles. The <em lang="la" xml:lang="la">Polyergus</em> thus laden flee as
	fast as possible, escaping as well as they can from the
	bereaved parents, who endeavour to save their offspring.
	The band returns to the nest by the same
	road that it came, although not the shortest, for these
	insects seem to lack the sense of direction and are
	guided by smell, so that they have to retrace all the
	windings of the road. The march is slackened by the
	weight of the booty (<a href="#fig7" id="fig7mark">Fig. 7</a>), and each travels according
	to his fancy, without following the regular order
	of the departure. At last the ants regain their
	household. The slaves, warned of the return of the
	victorious army, rush out to meet it and relieve the
	arrivals of their burdens, some in their zeal even
	carrying at the same time both the master and his
	burden. The nymphs transported into the ant-hill
	<a class="pagenum" id="page58" title="58"> </a>are henceforth cared for by their fellow-slaves; the
	<em lang="la" xml:lang="la">Polyergus</em> do not trouble themselves further.</p>

	<p><em id="ch_2_13" class="section_title">Wars of the ants.</em> — As sociable as man, the manners
	of ants present more than one resemblance to his.
	Slave-hunting expeditions are among these; the wars
	that these insects undertake also resemble human
	wars. The causes of the quarrel are of various
	nature, most often they result from the close proximity
	of two ant swarms. The rival colonies are
	always meeting in the same regions and seeking the
	same material; their mutual rivalry strains their
	relations. A moment comes when one of them is
	decidedly in the way of the other. At such a period,
	which is almost a diplomatic crisis, great excitement
	<a class="pagenum" id="page59" title="59"> </a>is observed in the two camps; there is a continual
	coming and going. One fine day, as the result of
	some unknown act, — some mysterious <em lang="la" xml:lang="la">casus belli</em> or
	declaration of war, — two armies place themselves on
	the march against each other. They advance in
	serried ranks. All ants do not follow the same
	tactics; some throw themselves out in a thicker line,
	while others form in squares. But as soon as action
	commences the individual regains his rights. It is a
	series of duels, of fierce hand-to-hand struggles.
	Legs are torn away, heads are cut off by strokes of
	the jaws, abdomens are disembowelled; a terrible
	fury animates the combatants, and nothing will
	disturb them from the battle. (<a href="#fig8" id="fig8mark">Fig. 8.</a>) By-and-by
	<a class="pagenum" id="page60" title="60"> </a>victory remains with the fiercest or the
	strongest; the vanquished draw in, carrying away
	as far as possible their wounded and their dead.
	Nothing more is seen on the field of carnage but
	separated limbs or heads which strew the ground like
	a multitude of small black points. Often the enmity
	is not extinguished after a battle, and several defeats
	are necessary before the weaker swarm is destroyed
	or forced to emigrate.<a href="#footnote_36" id="fnm36"  class="fnmarker">36</a></p>

	METHODS OF DEFENCE.</h2>

	<p class="chapter_contents">FLIGHT — FEINT — RESISTANCE IN COMMON BY SOCIAL
	   ANIMALS — SENTINELS.</p>

	<p class="first_paragraph"><span class="first_word">Studying</span> the animal kingdom in the manner here
	adopted, that is to say by passing in review the
	various manifestations of zoological life, we are
	necessarily led to find certain industries which are
	opposed to others. We have seen the various
	methods of hunting; but attack calls forth defence.
	In the struggle for life we find the action of beings
	on other beings, and the re-action of these latter;
	the final result is the expression of the difference
	between the two according as one or the other is
	stronger.</p>

	<p><em id="ch_3_1" class="section_title">Flight.</em> — Just as the most rudimentary method of
	attack is simple pursuit, so the most simple and
	natural method of defence is flight; but if very fleet
	animals like hares, gazelles, and deer can escape by
	simply exerting their maximum rapidity, it is not
	always thus, and certain species exercise in flight
	perfected methods appropriate to circumstances, and
	so raise this method of defence to an art.</p>

	<p>Of all animals the Ape most skilfully directs his
	flight. There is no question that in his intelligence
	we may find every rudiment of our own; but of all
	<a class="pagenum" id="page62" title="62"> </a>his qualities none more nearly approximates him to
	us than his courage. There are no animals, not even
	the great beasts of prey, who are so brave as Man and
	the Ape, and who are capable of so much presence of
	mind. It is perhaps this bravery which, joined to his
	sociability, has most contributed to assure the supremacy
	of the one. As to the other, the road has been
	barred to him by his better-endowed cousin; he is
	disappearing before Man, and not before nature or
	other animals. In thinly-inhabited regions he is still
	the king. It is generally considered that the Lion is
	the incarnation of courage, but he is the strongest and
	the best armed; there is none before whom he need
	tremble. In captivity he allows himself to be struck
	by the tamer, which the most miserable ape would
	never suffer. The Lion will struggle with extreme
	energy without calculating the difference of strength
	between his opponent and himself, and will resist as
	long as he is able to move. The Ape directs all his
	courage and presence of mind to order his flight
	when he has recognised a danger that is insurmountable.
	He does not act like those infatuated beasts
	who lose their head and rush away trembling, in
	their precipitation paralysing a great part of their
	resources. A band of apes in flight utilises all
	obstacles that can be interposed between themselves
	and the pursuer; they retire without excessive haste
	and take advantage of the first shelter met with; a
	female never abandons her young, and if a young one
	remains behind, and is in danger of being taken, the
	old males of the troop go back boldly to save it at
	the peril of their lives. In this connection many
	heroic facts have been narrated. This animal has too
	frequently been judged by comparison with ourselves;
	<a class="pagenum" id="page63" title="63"> </a>he has been regarded as a human caricature and
	covered with ridicule. We obtain a very much
	higher idea of him if we compare him with other
	animals. Always and everywhere there has been
	a prejudiced insistence on his defects; we perceive
	them so easily because they are an exaggeration
	of our own; but he also possesses qualities of the
	first order.</p>

	<p>As an example of flight arranged with intelligence,
	we have already seen how the <em lang="la" xml:lang="la">Formica fusca</em> profits
	by the difficulty experienced by the <em lang="la" xml:lang="la">Polyergus</em> in
	climbing. It hastily gains the summit of a blade of
	grass, to place there in safety the larvæ which the
	others wish to carry away. The ruses adopted in
	flight are as varied as those of attack. Every animal
	tries to profit as much as possible by all his resources.</p>

	<p>Larks, a feeble race of birds, rise higher in the air
	than any rapacious bird, and this is often a cause of
	safety. Their greatest enemy is the Hobby (<em lang="la" xml:lang="la">Hypotriorchis
	sublutes</em>). They fear him greatly, so that as
	soon as one appears singing ceases, and each suddenly
	closes his wings, falls to the earth and hides against
	the soil. But some have mounted so high to pour
	out their clear song that they cannot hope to reach
	the earth before being seized. Then, knowing that
	the bird of prey is to be feared when he occupies a
	more elevated position from which he can throw himself
	on them, they endeavour to remain always
	above him. They mount higher and higher. The
	enemy seeks to pass them, but they mount still,
	until at last the Hobby, heavier, and little accustomed
	to this rarefied air, grows tired and gives up the
	pursuit.<a href="#footnote_37" id="fnm37"  class="fnmarker">37</a></p>

	<p><a class="pagenum" id="page64" title="64"> </a>The Gold-winged Woodpecker of the United States
	(<em lang="la" xml:lang="la">Colaptes auratus</em>) often escapes Falcons either by
	throwing himself into the first hole that he finds, or if
	he cannot find one, through seizing the trunk of a tree
	with his claws. As he is a very good climber, he
	describes rapid spirals around it, and the falcon
	cannot in flying trace such small circles. By this
	method the <em lang="la" xml:lang="la">Colaptes</em> usually escapes.<a href="#footnote_38" id="fnm38"  class="fnmarker">38</a></p>

	<p>The Fox, who is so ingenious in hunting, is not
	less so when his own safety is concerned. He knows
	when it is best to flee or to remain; he is suspicious in
	a surprising degree, not only of man but also of the
	engines which man prepares against him. He recognises
	them or smells them. Certain facts almost lead
	us to suspect that he understands their mechanism.
	When one of them has been surprised in his hole,
	and the trap has been placed before every opening,
	he will not emerge from the burrow. If hunger
	becomes too imperious, he recognises that patience
	will only change the manner of his death, and then
	he decides to dare fate; but previously he had done
	everything to flee without passing over the snare.
	As long as he had claws and strength he hollowed out
	the earth to form a new issue, but hunger rapidly
	exhausted his vigour and he was not able to complete
	the work. Foxes thus trapped have recognised immediately
	when one of these engines went off, either
	owing to another animal being caught or from some
	other reason. In this case the captive understands
	very well that the mechanism has produced its
	effect, that it is no longer to be dreaded, and he
	boldly emerges.</p>

	<p><a class="pagenum" id="page65" title="65"> </a>It has happened that foxes have been caught in a
	trap by a paw or else by the tail, when delicately
	endeavouring to extract the bait. Recognising the
	manner in which they are retained prisoners, certain
	of them have had the intelligence and the courage to
	cut off with their teeth the part engaged in the trap,
	and to escape thus mutilated. St. John knew a fox
	who thus escaped by amputating a paw, and who was
	able to earn his living for three or four years subsequently,
	when he was finally caught.</p>

	<p>In Australia great kangaroo hunts are organised.
	Generally the capture is sufficiently easy, and the
	dogs are able to seize the kangaroo, but sometimes
	he makes a long and rather original defence. If
	possible, he directs his flight towards a river. If he
	reaches it he enters, and, thanks to his great height,
	he is able to go on foot to a depth where the dogs
	are obliged to swim. Arrived there, he plants himself
	on his two posterior legs and his tail, and, up to his
	shoulders in the water, awaits the arrival of the pack.
	With his anterior paws he seizes by the head the first
	dog who approaches him, and, as he is more solidly
	balanced than his assailant, he holds the dog’s nose
	beneath the water as long as he can. Unless a second
	dog speedily comes to the rescue the first is inevitably
	drowned. If a companion arrives to free him, he is so
	disturbed by this unexpected bath that he regains the
	bank as quickly as possible, and has no further desire to
	attack this suffocating prey. A strong and courageous
	old male can thus hold his own against twenty or
	thirty dogs, drowning some and frightening others,
	and the hunter is obliged to intervene and put an end
	to this energetic defence by a bullet.<a href="#footnote_39" id="fnm39"  class="fnmarker">39</a></p>

	<p><a class="pagenum" id="page66" title="66"> </a><em id="ch_3_2" class="section_title">Feint.</em> — Many animals, when they cannot escape
	danger by flight, seek safety by various feints. The
	device of feigning death is especially widespread.</p>

	<p>Many coleopterous insects and Spiders simulate
	death to perfection, although it has been ascertained
	that they do not always adopt the attitude which
	members of their species fall into when really dead.
	But they remain perfectly motionless; neither leg
	nor antenna stirs. McCook, who has devoted such
	loving study to Spiders, remarks in his magnificent
	work, that the Orbweavers, especially, possess this
	habit. “One who touches an Orbweaver when hanging
	upon its web will often be surprised to see it
	suddenly cast itself from the snare, or appear to drop
	from it, as though shot off by some unseen force.
	Unless he understands the nature of the creature he
	will be utterly at a loss to know what has become of
	it. In truth it has simply dropped upon the ground
	by a long thread which had been instantaneously
	emitted, and had maintained the Aranead in its remarkable
	exit, so that its fall was not only harmless,
	but its return to the web assured. The legs are
	drawn up around the body, and to the inexperienced
	eye it has the external semblance of death. In this
	condition it may be handled, it may be turned over,
	it may be picked up, and, for a little while at least,
	will retain its death-like appearance.” Preyer, who
	has studied this phenomenon in various animals,
	comes to the conclusion that it is usually due to
	unconsciousness as the result of fright.<a href="#footnote_40" id="fnm40"  class="fnmarker">40</a> McCook is
	unable to accept this theory of kataplexy, so far as
	Spiders are concerned. “I have frequently watched
	<a class="pagenum" id="page67" title="67"> </a>Spiders in this condition,” he observes, “to determine
	the point in question, and their behaviour always
	impressed me as being a genuine feigning of death,
	and therefore entirely within their volition. The
	evidence is of such indefinite nature that one can
	hardly venture to give it visible expression, but my
	conviction is none the less decided. I may say,
	however, that my observations indicate that the
	Spiders remained in this condition as long as there
	seemed to be any threatened danger; now and again
	the legs would be relaxed slightly, as though the
	creature were about getting ready to resume its
	normal condition, but at the slightest alarm withheld
	its purpose and relapsed into rigidity. The slight
	unclasping of the legs, the faint quivering indications
	of a purpose to come to life, and then the instant
	suppression of the purpose, were so many evidences
	that the power of volition was retained, and that the
	Aranead might have at once recovered if it had been
	disposed to do so. Again, I think that I have never
	noticed anything like that gradual emergence from
	the kataplectic condition which one would naturally
	expect if the act were not a voluntary one. On
	the contrary, the spider invariably recovered, immediately
	sprang upon its legs, and hoisted itself
	to its snare, or ran vigorously away among the
	grasses.”<a href="#footnote_41" id="fnm41"  class="fnmarker">41</a></p>

	<p>Among fish, the Perch and the Sturgeon feign
	<a class="pagenum" id="page68" title="68"> </a>death; according to Couch,<a href="#footnote_42" id="fnm42"  class="fnmarker">42</a> the Landrail, the Skylark,
	the Corncrake adopt the same device. Among
	mammals, the best-known example is probably the
	Opossum.</p>

	<p>An Opossum (<em lang="la" xml:lang="la">Didelphys azaræ</em>) of South America
	enters farms to devastate the poultry yards. When
	he is discovered he runs away, but is soon caught,
	and blows from sticks rain upon him. Seeing that he
	cannot escape correction he seeks at least to save his
	life. Letting his head fall and straightening his inert
	legs he receives the blows without flinching. Often
	he is considered dead, and abandoned. The cunning
	little beast, who desires nothing better, arises, shakes
	himself, and rather bruised, but at all events alive,
	takes his way back to the wood.</p>

	<p>The Argentine Fox (<em lang="la" xml:lang="la">Canis azaræ</em>), when caught in
	a trap or run down by dogs, though it fights savagely
	at first, after a time drops down and apparently dies.
	“When in this condition of feigning death,” Mr.
	W. H. Hudson remarks, “I am quite sure that the
	animal does not altogether lose consciousness. It is
	exceedingly difficult to discover any evidence of life
	in the opossum, but when one withdraws a little way
	from the feigning fox, and watches him very attentively,
	a slight opening of the eye may be detected;
	and, finally, when left to himself, he does not recover
	and start up like an animal that has been stunned,
	but slowly and cautiously raises his head first, and
	only gets up when his foes are at a safe distance.
	Yet I have seen <em lang="es" xml:lang="es">guachos</em>, who are very cruel to
	animals, practise the most barbarous experiments on
	a captive fox without being able to rouse it into
	exhibiting any sign of life. This has greatly puzzled
	<a class="pagenum" id="page69" title="69"> </a>me, since, if death-feigning is simply a cunning habit,
	the animal could not suffer itself to be mutilated without
	wincing. I can only believe that the fox, though
	not insensible, as its behaviour on being left to itself
	appears to prove, yet has its body thrown by extreme
	terror into that benumbed condition which simulates
	death, and during which it is unable to feel the
	tortures practised on it. The swoon sometimes
	actually takes place before the animal has been
	touched, and even when the exciting cause is at a
	considerable distance.”<a href="#footnote_43" id="fnm43"  class="fnmarker">43</a></p>

	<p>It is probably a measure of prudence which impels
	certain birds to imitate successively the cries of neighbouring
	animals, in order to persuade their enemies
	that all the beasts in creation are brought together in
	this spot except themselves. It is perhaps going a
	little too far to suppose so reflective and diplomatic
	a motive, but it is not doubtful that in certain cases
	this custom can be very useful to them by putting
	their enemies on the wrong scent. In North America
	nearly all the species of the Cassique family have this
	custom. If they wish to deceive the ears of the great
	Falcons who watch them — or is it simple amusement? — they
	interrupt their own song to introduce the most
	varied melodies. If a sheep bleats, the bird immediately
	replies to the bleating; the clucking of a turkey,
	the cackling of a goose, the cry of the toucan are
	noted and faithfully reproduced. Then the Cassique
	returns to his own special refrain, to abandon it anew
	on the first opportunity.<a href="#footnote_44" id="fnm44"  class="fnmarker">44</a></p>

	<p>Not only do animals thus feign death in order to
	secure their own safety, but the female sometimes
	<a class="pagenum" id="page70" title="70"> </a>endeavours to attract an enemy’s attention and feigns
	to be wounded in order to decoy him away from her
	young. This trick is adopted especially by birds. In
	illustration of this it will be sufficient to quote from
	Bendire’s <cite>Life Histories of North American Birds</cite>
	some observations by Mr. Ernest Thompson of
	Toronto, regarding the Canadian Ruffled Grouse
	(<em lang="la" xml:lang="la">Bonasa umbellus togata</em>), commonly called the Partridge
	by Canadians: — “Every field man must be
	acquainted with the simulation of lameness, by which
	many birds decoy or try to decoy intruders from their
	nests. This is an invariable device of the Partridge,
	and I have no doubt that it is quite successful with
	the natural foes of the bird; indeed it is often so with
	Man. A dog, as I have often seen, is certain to be
	misled and duped, and there is little doubt that a
	mink, skunk, racoon, fox, coyote, or wolf would fare
	no better. Imagine the effects of the bird’s tactics
	on a prowling fox: he has scented her as she sits; he
	is almost upon her, but she has been watching him,
	and suddenly, with a loud ‘whirr,’ she springs up and
	tumbles a few yards before him. The suddenness
	and noise with which the bird appears cause the fox
	to be totally carried away; he forgets all his former
	experience, he never thinks of the eggs, his mind is
	filled with the thought of the wounded bird almost
	within his reach; a few more bounds and his
	meal will be secured. So he springs and springs,
	and very nearly catches her, and in his excitement
	he is led on, and away, till finally the bird flies
	off, leaving him a quarter of a mile or more from
	the nest.</p>

	<p>“If instead of eggs the Partridge has chicks, she
	does not await the coming of the enemy, but runs to
	<a class="pagenum" id="page71" title="71"> </a>meet and mislead him ere yet he is in the neighbourhood
	of the brood; she then leads him far away, and
	returning by a circuitous route, gathers her young
	together again by her clucking. When surprised she
	utters a well-known danger-signal, a peculiar whine,
	whereupon the young ones hide under logs and
	among grass. Many persons say they will each
	seize a leaf in their beaks and then turn over on
	their backs. I have never found any support for
	this idea, although I have often seen one of the little
	creatures crawl under a dead leaf.”<a href="#footnote_45" id="fnm45"  class="fnmarker">45</a></p>

	<p><em id="ch_3_4" class="section_title">Resistance in common by social animals.</em> — If neither
	flight nor feint has saved an animal from the hunter,
	he naturally fights as long as he can, but this struggle
	<em lang="la" xml:lang="la">in extremis</em> is rarely crowned with success. Certain
	species, especially those which live in society, are
	able nevertheless, by uniting their efforts, to resist
	enemies who would easily triumph over them if they
	were isolated.</p>

	<p>Among tribes of Apes mutual assistance, as described
	by Brehm, is common. When by chance a
	bird of prey, such as an eagle, has thrown himself on
	a young ape who is amusing himself far from the
	maternal eye, the little one does not let himself be
	taken without resistance; he clings to the branches
	and utters shrill and despairing cries. His appeals
	are heard, and in an instant a dozen agile males
	arrive to save him; they throw themselves on the
	imprudent ravisher and seize him, one by the claw,
	another by the neck, another by a wing, pulling him
	about and harassing him. The bird struggles as well
	as he can, distributing around him blows from talons
	<a class="pagenum" id="page72" title="72"> </a>and beak. But he is often strangled, and when his
	temerity does not receive this extreme punishment,
	the feathers which fall from him when he flies away
	bear witness that he has not emerged unscathed from
	the scuffle.</p>

	<p>Animals like Buffaloes resist by a common defence
	the most terrible Carnivora. Even the Tiger is their
	victim, although if one of them met that wild beast
	alone he would surely become its prey. Being very
	agile, the tiger can reach by one leap the back of the
	ruminant, whose brutal and massive force cannot thus
	be exercised; but the feline who falls into the midst
	of a troop fares very badly. One buffalo falls on him
	with lowered horns, and with a robust blow of the
	head throws him into the air. The tiger cannot
	regain his senses, for as soon as he reaches the
	ground, and often even before, he is again seized
	and thrown towards other horns. Thus thrown from
	one to another like a ball, he is promptly put to
	death.</p>

	<p>The less terrible Carnivora give Buffaloes no
	trouble. Wolves do not dare to attack them when
	they are united; they await in ambush the passage
	of some strayed calf, and rapidly gain possession of
	it before the rest of the flock are aware, or they would
	dearly pay for their attack.</p>

	<p>The Bisons of North America, near relatives of the
	Buffaloes, also repulse Wolves in common; and if
	Man succeeds better against them it is owing to
	the skill which he shows in hiding himself and not
	attracting their attention. Every one knows how
	Indians hunt the Bison with arrows, and his pursuit
	is very risky to the hunter, for he must not be discovered
	by the game, as he would then be trodden
	<a class="pagenum" id="page73" title="73"> </a>underfoot or disembowelled. In the immense prairies
	where these ruminants feed, a few Indians covered by
	bisons’ skins advance on all fours, so that nothing
	betrays their presence. The victims fall one by one
	beneath silent blows, and their companions, who can
	see nothing suspicious in the neighbourhood, are not
	disturbed, supposing them, no doubt, to be peacefully
	resting.</p>

	<p>It is not only against other animals that these great
	mammals have to defend themselves; they are much
	afraid of heat, and they are accustomed, especially in
	the south of Persia, to ruminate while lying in the
	water during the hot hours of the day. They only
	allow the end of the snout, or at most the head, to
	appear. It is a curious spectacle when fording a
	river to see emerge from the reeds the great heads
	and calm eyes of the Buffaloes, who follow with
	astonishment all the movements of the horsemen,
	although nothing will disturb their sweet and fresh
	siesta.</p>

	<p>But let us return to defences arranged in common.
	Horses are extremely sociable, and in the immense
	pampas of South America those who become wild
	again live in large troops. In difficult circumstances
	they help one another. If a great danger threatens
	them all the colts and mares assemble together, and
	the stallions form a circle round the group, ready to
	drive back the assailant. But they do not accomplish
	this manœuvre in the presence of an enemy of small
	importance. When a wolf appears on the plain all
	the males run after him, seeking to strike him with
	their feet and kill him, unless prompt flight delivers
	him from their blows.</p>

	<p>The sociable humour of these horses makes them
	<a class="pagenum" id="page74" title="74"> </a>compassionate towards their fellows who are enslaved
	by man, and if a harnessed cart meets on its road a
	free band, it is a serious matter to the owner. They
	run up and surround the enslaved horse, saluting
	him with their cries and gambols, having the air of
	inviting him to throw his harness to the winds and
	follow them on the plain, where grass grows for all
	without work. Naturally the driver endeavours to
	preserve his noble conquest, and distributes blows
	with the whip to those who wish to debauch it. Then
	the wild horses become furious, and throw themselves
	on the vehicle; they break it with their feet and cut
	their comrade’s traces with their teeth to enable
	him to share their own free life. The enterprise
	satisfactorily concluded, they gallop away neighing
	in triumph.</p>

	<p>It is owing to their union in large bands that Crows
	have so little to fear from diurnal birds of prey; if
	one approaches, they do not hesitate to throw themselves
	on him altogether. The Great Horn Owl,
	however, causes many ravages among them; for
	when asleep at night the Crow is without defence
	against the ravisher, for whom, on the contrary,
	obscurity is propitious. Thus they recognise him
	as a hereditary enemy, and never allow an opportunity
	of revenge to pass without profiting by it.
	If by chance an owl appears by day and one of
	them perceives him, immediately a clamour arises — a
	veritable cry of war; all those who are in the
	neighbourhood fly to the spot, and business ceases;
	the nocturnal bird of prey is assaulted, riddled with
	blows from beaks, stunned, his feathers torn out,
	and, notwithstanding his defence, he succumbs to
	numbers.</p>

	<p><a class="pagenum" id="page75" title="75"> </a>In all the preceding examples the social species
	unite for the common security the forces and effects
	which they can derive from their own organs.</p>

	<p>I have spoken of the Apes and described how they
	defend themselves with their hands and teeth; but in
	certain cases they use weapons, employing foreign
	objects like a club or like projectiles.</p>

	<p>Acts of this nature are considered to indicate a
	high degree of development, and it has often been
	repeated that they are the appanage of man alone;
	we have, however, seen the <em lang="la" xml:lang="la">Toxotes</em>, who, like all
	fishes, is not particularly intelligent, squirt water on
	to his victims. It is not easy to understand how a
	greater intellectual effort is required to throw a stone
	with the hand than to project water with the mouth.
	This is what the apes do, throwing on their assailants
	from the heights of trees everything which comes
	to hand: cocoa-nuts, hard fruits, fragments of
	wood, etc.</p>

	<p>Baboons (<em lang="la" xml:lang="la">Cynocephali</em>) who usually live in the
	midst of rocks protect their retreat by rolling very
	heavy blocks on to their aggressors, or by forcibly
	throwing stones about the size of the fist. As these
	bands may contain from a hundred to one hundred
	and fifty individuals, it is a veritable hail of stones of
	all sizes which they roll down from the heights of the
	mountains where they find shelter.</p>

	<p><em id="ch_3_5" class="section_title">Sentinels.</em> — Not only do Apes know how to face
	danger or to avoid it by a prudent flight, but they
	also seek to foresee it, and to avoid exposing themselves
	to it. A troop of Apes, according to Brehm,
	generally places the leadership in the hands of a
	robust and experienced male. This primitive royalty
	is founded partly on the confidence inspired by an
	<a class="pagenum" id="page76" title="76"> </a>old chief, and partly by the fear inspired by his
	muscular arms and ferocious canine teeth. (<a href="#fig9" id="fig9mark">Fig. 9.</a>)
	He gives himself a great deal of trouble for the
	security of his subjects, and does not abuse the
	authority which he possesses. Always at the head,
	he leaps from branch to branch, and the band follows
	him. From time to time he scales a tall tree, and
	from its heights scrutinises the neighbourhood. If
	he discovers nothing suspicious a particular guttural
	grunt gives information to his companions. If, on
	the contrary, he perceives some danger he warns
	them by another cry, and all draw in ready to follow
	him in his retreat, which he directs in the same way
	as he guided the forward march.</p>

	<p>Apes are not alone in relying on the experience of
	one of their members. Many other animals act in
	the same way: antelopes, gazelles, elephants, who
	advance in troops always conducted by an old male
	or female who knows all the forest paths, all the
	places favourable to pasture, and all the regions
	which must be avoided.</p>

	<div id="fig9" class="figcenter"><a class="pagenum disguise" id="page77" title="77"> </a>
		<a href="images/fig_09.png"><img src="images/th_fig_09.png" width="414" height="271" alt="A group of small apes. Some carrying babies, others keeping watch." /></a>
		<p class="caption"><a href="#fig9mark">Fig. 9.</a></p>
	</div>

	<p>Others, more democratic, instead of giving up the
	care of their safety to one individual, which cannot be
	done without abdicating some degree of individual
	independence, dispose around the place which they
	occupy a certain number of sentinels charged to
	watch over the common safety. This custom exists
	among prairie dogs, moufflons, crows, paroquets,
	and a great many other animals. The sentinels of
	the crows are not only always on the watch, but they
	are extremely discriminating; they do not give a
	warning at the wrong time. It is certain that these
	birds can distinguish a man armed with a gun from
	another who merely carries a stick, and they allow the
	<a class="pagenum" id="page78" title="78"> </a>second to approach much nearer than the first before
	giving the alarm.</p>

	<p>Paroquets of all species live in joyous and noisy
	bands. After having passed the night on the same
	tree they disperse in the neighbourhood, not without
	having first posted watchers here and there, and they
	are very attentive to their cries and indications.</p>

	<p>The great Aras or Macaws, the large and handsome
	parrots of the Andes, act with much prudence when
	circumstances make it advisable, and they know when
	they ought to be on their guard. When they are in
	the depths of the forest, their own domain, they
	gather fruits in the midst of a deafening noise; each
	one squalls and cries according to his own humour.
	But if they have resolved to pillage a field of maize,
	as experience has taught them that these joyous
	manifestations would then be unseasonable and would
	not fail to attract the furious proprietor, they consummate
	the robbery in perfect silence. Sentinels are
	placed on the neighbouring trees. To the first warning
	a low cry responds; on the second, announcing a
	nearer danger, all the band fly away with vociferations
	which need no longer be restrained. The common
	Crane (<em lang="la" xml:lang="la">Grus cinerea</em>), still more far-seeing to avoid a
	possible future danger, despatches scouts who are thus
	distinct from sentinels who inform their fellows of
	present danger.<a href="#footnote_46" id="fnm46"  class="fnmarker">46</a></p>

	<p>When these birds have been disturbed in any spot,
	they never return without great precautions. Before
	arriving, they stop; a few only go circumspectly
	forward, examining everything, and coming back to
	make their report. If this is not satisfactory the
	troop remains suspicious, sending new messengers.
	<a class="pagenum" id="page79" title="79"> </a>When they are at last assured that there is really
	nothing to fear, the rest follow.</p>

	<p>Thus by the most varied methods animals endeavour
	to save their threatened lives, and succeed to
	some extent in attaining safety. Destruction and the
	chase on one side, conservation and flight on the
	other: these are the two chief acts which occupy
	living beings. Many, however, less threatened, succeed
	in perfecting their manner of life, and employ their
	industry in less pressing occupations than eating
	others or preventing others from eating them.</p>

	assuring the existence of the individual — never arrive
	at a very extraordinary degree of perfection; or at
	all events, as they are indispensable to existence, we

	that an industry marks a higher degree
	of civilisation not only by its development, but still
	more by its reference to the less necessary things of
	life; in every species the importance of the place
	given to the superfluous is a mark of superiority.
	The animals who, foreseeing a hard season, or fearing
	<a class="pagenum" id="page81" title="81"> </a>the days when hunting will not be productive, lay up
	provisions to utilise in such times of famine, rise a
	degree higher than even the most skilful hunters.
	Not all amass with the same sagacity, and we shall
	find different examples of foresight, from the most
	rudimentary to the highest, very near what we may
	observe in Man.</p>

	<p>The provisions harvested by animals have more
	than one destination: some are for the individual
	himself who has gathered them; others, on the contrary,
	are to serve as the food for his young at the
	age when they are not yet capable of seeking their own
	food. I will deal with these latter in another chapter,
	and propose at present only to speak of those animals
	who provision barns with the intention of themselves
	profiting by them.</p>

	<p>The foresight of the animal is so much the greater
	the more remote the future for which he prepares.
	The Carnivora live from day to day and lay up no
	stores; it is the Rodents, certain frugivorous birds,
	and insects who exhibit the most complicated acts of
	economy.</p>

	<p><em id="ch_4_1" class="section_title">Provisions laid up for a short period.</em> — As a rudimentary
	example of the art of preserving food in
	view of possible famine, I may mention the case of
	the <em lang="la" xml:lang="la">Lanius collurio</em>. I have already spoken of this
	bird and of his custom in days of abundance of
	spitting on thorns all the captures he has made. One
	may see side by side Coleoptera, crickets, grasshoppers,
	frogs, and small birds. It is evident that
	these reserves cannot be preserved for more than a
	day, or at most two days. The bird amasses just
	enough to show us his apprehensions of the possible
	future lack of success in hunting, and his thought of
	<a class="pagenum" id="page82" title="82"> </a>preserving the surplus of the present in view of
	privations to come.<a href="#footnote_47" id="fnm47"  class="fnmarker">47</a></p>

	<p>The Fox, a very skilful hunter, has no trouble in
	finding game; of all the Carnivora he is, however, the
	only one who is truly foreseeing. The others in
	presence of abundant food gorge themselves, and
	abandon the rest at the risk of suffering to-morrow.
	The fox is not so careless. If he has had the good
	fortune to discover a poultry yard, well supplied but
	ill watched, he carries away as many fowls as he can
	before dawn and hides them in the neighbourhood of
	his burrow. He places each by itself, one at the foot
	of a hedge, another beneath a bush, a third in a hole
	rapidly hollowed out and closed up again. It is said
	that he thus scatters his treasures to avoid the risk of
	losing all at one stroke, although this prudence complicates
	his task when he needs to utilise his provisions.
	The fox, however, loses nothing, and knows
	very well where to find his stores. The very nature
	of the game prevents him from keeping it more than
	a few days.</p>

	<p><em id="ch_4_2" class="section_title">Provisions laid up for a long period.</em> — The Rodents,
	who live on dry fruits or grains, can on the other
	hand preserve them for a long time in their barns.
	The Squirrel, who may be seen all the summer leaping
	like a little madman from branch to branch, and who
	seems to have no cares except to exhibit his red
	fleece and show off his tail, is, contrary to appearance,
	a most sensible and methodical animal. He knows
	that winter is a hard time for poor beasts, and that
	fruits are then rare or hidden beneath the snow; in
	the autumn, therefore, when all the riches of the earth
	are abundant, and beech-nuts, acorns, and chestnuts
	<a class="pagenum" id="page83" title="83"> </a>have ripened, he harvests quantities of them and
	hides them wherever he can. Making use of the
	cavities he is acquainted with around his domain,
	hollow trees, holes that he makes in the earth beneath
	bushes, etc., he fills them with fruits, and when winter
	has come he extracts them to munch.</p>

	<p><em id="ch_4_3" class="section_title">Animals who construct barns.</em> — The Field Rat of
	Hungary and Asia (<em lang="la" xml:lang="la">Psammomys</em>) gathers wheat
	during the summer. He cuts the blades and transports
	them to his home, where he stores them up in
	very considerable quantities; and during rigorous
	winters when famine appears also among men,
	gleaners of another species appear on the scene and
	seek for corn under the earth in the nests of the
	<em lang="la" xml:lang="la">Psammomys</em>. A single rat can store up more than a
	bushel. Those who are skilful in finding their holes
	can thus in a day glean a good harvest, to the detriment
	of the rats who are thus in their turn reduced to
	beggary.</p>

	<p>The Hamster also makes provision of grain, but he
	introduces two improvements: the first at the harvest
	by only taking the edible part of the ear, and the
	second by constructing barns distinct from his home.
	Each possesses a burrow composed of a sleeping
	chamber, around which he has hollowed one or two
	others communicating with the first by passages, and
	intended to serve as barns. The old and more experienced
	animals prepare even four or five of these
	storehouses. The end of summer is their season for
	work. They scatter themselves in the fields of barley
	or wheat, pull down the stalks of the cereals with their
	anterior paws, and then cut off the ear with their
	teeth. This done, they set about thrashing their
	wheat — that is to say, they separate the grain from the
	<a class="pagenum" id="page84" title="84"> </a>straw by turning the ear round and round between
	their paws. When the grains come out they pile
	them up in their cheeks, and thus transport them to
	one of the chambers already mentioned; they then
	return to exploit the field and continue these labours
	until they have completed the stores for winter.</p>

	<p>A certain Vole (<em lang="la" xml:lang="la">Arvicola economus</em>) acts in much
	the same way as the Hamster, though he harvests a
	different class of objects. It is not wheat which he
	collects but roots. He has to find these roots, to dig
	them up, to cut them into fragments of suitable
	dimensions for transport, and finally to pile them up in
	rooms disposed to receive them. This species, which
	inhabits Siberia, measures about twelve centimetres in
	length, but during summer and autumn Voles accomplish
	an amount of work which is surprising having
	regard to their size. The moment having arrived to
	think about winter, the Voles spread themselves about
	the steppe. Each hollows little pits around the roots
	he wishes to extract. After having bared them he
	cleans them while still in position, so as not to
	encumber his storehouses with useless earth. This
	preparatory labour having been completed, he divides
	the root into slices of a weight proportioned to his
	strength, and carries away the fragments one by one.
	Seizing each with his teeth, he walks backwards drawing
	it after him, and thus traverses a long road,
	crossing paths, going round tufts of grass or other
	obstacles, not letting himself be rebuffed by the
	difficulty and length of the task. Arrived at his hole,
	he enters this also backwards, drawing his burden
	through all his galleries. His dwelling, though the
	entrance is rather more complicated, resembles that
	of the Hamster. Like the latter, it is composed of a
	<a class="pagenum" id="page85" title="85"> </a>central room placed in communication with the outside
	by a maze of passages, which cross one another.
	That is the sleeping-room, the walls of which are well
	formed, and which is carpeted with hay. From this
	various underground passages start which lead to the
	storerooms, which are three or four in number. It is to
	these that the Vole bears his harvest. Each compartment
	is large enough to contain four or five kilogrammes
	of roots, so that the little rodent finds himself at the
	end of the season the proprietor of about fifteen kilogrammes
	of food in reserve. He would have enough
	to enable him to revel in abundance if he were able
	to reckon without his neighbours. This diligent
	animal has in fact one terrible parasite. This is
	Man, who will not allow him to enjoy in peace the
	fruits of his long labour and economy. In Siberia, a
	long and severe winter follows a very hot summer; in
	this season the inhabitants often lack provisions. A
	moment comes when they are glad to make up for
	want of bread by edible roots; but the search for
	these is long and troublesome, and should indeed
	have been thought of during summer. Man, during
	the fine weather less foreseeing than the rodent,
	does not hesitate when famine has come to turn to
	him for help. As he is the weaker, the Vole is
	obliged to submit to this vexatious tax. According
	to Pallas,<a href="#footnote_48" id="fnm48"  class="fnmarker">48</a> the inhabitants seek these nests full
	of provisions and dig them up. The conqueror
	takes all he pleases, and abandons the rest to
	the unfortunate little beast, who, whether he likes
	it or not, has to be content. In this region the
	<a class="pagenum" id="page86" title="86"> </a>burrows of the Vole abound; therefore this singular
	tithe ensures a considerable revenue to
	those who levy it, as may be understood when we
	remember the extent of the stores amassed by the
	animal.</p>

	<p>A Vole resembling the <em lang="la" xml:lang="la">Arvicola arvalis</em>, but larger,
	paler, and more rat-like, with large shining eyes and
	very short tail, overran in 1892-93 the classic land
	of Thessaly, the land of Olympus, and the Vale of
	Tempe. It has always inhabited this region, and the
	old Greeks had an Apollo Smintheus, or Myoktonos,
	the Mouse-destroying God. “At the beginning of
	March,” according to Prof. Loeffler, who has given an
	account of this invasion,<a href="#footnote_49" id="fnm49"  class="fnmarker">49</a> “the Voles were only beginning
	to troop from the slopes of the hills and the
	fallow-lands to the cultivated fields. It was frequently
	observed that they followed regular paths during their
	inroads. Thus they advanced along the railway embankment.
	Their progress seemed to be rather slow.
	Perhaps they do not advance further till the inhabitants
	of one of their strongholds or so-called castles
	have become too numerous. The runs which they
	excavate are at a depth of about twenty to thirty
	centimetres below the surface of the ground. The
	extent of their runs varies, and we found them extending
	in length from thirty to forty metres and
	more. These runs are connected with the surface by
	vertical holes of about five centimetres in diameter.
	In many places four, five, and more holes have led to
	the same run. In such cases there is generally, not
	far off, an enlargement for the nest, lined with finely-ground
	vegetable material, where the young are produced
	<a class="pagenum" id="page87" title="87"> </a>and reared. In front of newly-opened holes the
	earth, which has been thrown far out, forms smooth
	hillocks. There were many well-defined and well-trodden
	paths on the ground, by which the Voles pass
	from one hole to another. They are never seen out
	of their holes by day, not even in places where the
	entire ground is riddled with holes like a sieve. They
	do not come out in search of food till the evening;
	even then not many are to be seen, but the peculiar
	squeaking noise they make is to be heard everywhere.
	Next day all sorts of freshly-severed plants are to be
	found in the holes. Stalks of corn they manipulate
	by standing on their hind legs and gnawing through
	the stalk; when this is bitten off they drag it into
	their holes to devour it there, sometimes making it
	smaller. They do their work with amazing rapidity.
	One evening a field was visited which was to be
	mowed next day, but when the labourers came in the
	morning they found nothing to cut. The Voles had
	destroyed the entire crop in a single night. A miller
	in the neighbourhood of Velestino reported that he
	went to his field early one morning, cut a measure of
	corn, loaded it on his ass, and brought it to his mill.
	When he returned to his mill with a second load
	he found scarcely a vestige of the first remaining.
	Thinking it had been stolen he kept watch for the
	thief; but suddenly, to his great astonishment, hosts
	of Voles appeared and set to work to carry off the
	second load.” Such facts as these recorded by
	Loeffler are by no means a merely recent phenomenon;
	Aristotle was familiar with the devastations
	of the Voles, and wrote that “some small farmers,
	having one day observed that their corn was ready
	for harvest, when they went the following day to cut
	<a class="pagenum" id="page88" title="88"> </a>their corn, found it all eaten.” Other ancient writers
	record similar facts.<a href="#footnote_50" id="fnm50"  class="fnmarker">50</a></p>

	<p>Two birds of North America, belonging to the
	Woodpecker family, prepare their provisions for the
	bad season with consummate art; not only do they
	harvest them and place them in shelter, but they
	arrange them in such a manner that at the right
	moment they can utilise them in the most convenient
	manner.</p>

	<p>One of them which is common in California, the
	<em lang="la" xml:lang="la">Melanerpes formicivorus</em>, nourishes himself, as his name
	indicates, by insects, and especially ants. All the
	summer he gives himself up to this hunt, but at the
	same time he collects acorns, which he does not
	touch, however, so long as he can find other food.
	He amasses them in the following ingenious manner:
	he chooses a tree and hollows out in its trunk a cavity
	just capable of receiving one acorn. He then carries
	a fruit and introduces it forcibly into the hole he
	has just made. Thus buried, the acorn can neither
	fall nor become the prey of another animal. In the
	domain of these birds trees may be found which are
	riddled like a sieve with holes stopped up by an
	acorn as by a plug. When the hunting of insects
	ceases to be fruitful, the <em lang="la" xml:lang="la">Melanerpes</em> visits his barns.
	If an ordinary bird wished to eat one of these fruits,
	at each stroke of his beak, on account of the polish
	and convexity of the acorn’s surface, it would escape
	<a class="pagenum" id="page89" title="89"> </a>him, and only by a series of reiterated efforts would
	the interior be exposed; but for the American woodpecker
	the task is simplified; each acorn being maintained
	firmly in the bark, it is sufficient to break the
	envelope and the pulp is easily seized.<a href="#footnote_51" id="fnm51"  class="fnmarker">51</a></p>

	<p>A relation of this bird, the <em lang="la" xml:lang="la">Colaptes mexicanus</em>, does
	not yield to him in economy and skill. He places
	his barn in the interior of a plant which is very
	abundant in the zone he inhabits. Insectivorous
	during a part of the year, he is forced to renounce
	this diet during the dry season. In the regions of
	Mexico where this bird is found the dry period is so
	absolute that he would die of hunger for want of
	insects or fruits if he had not taken the precaution of
	laying up stores during spring. His store consists of
	acorns. He has not time to fix them one by one, like
	the <em lang="la" xml:lang="la">Melanerpes</em>, and only thinks at first of rapidly
	collecting a large quantity. But it is in deciding the
	question as to where they are to be laid up that the
	<em lang="la" xml:lang="la">Colaptes</em> shows his remarkable intelligence. In the
	forests where he lives are to be found aloes, yuccas, and
	agaves. When the agaves have flowered, the flower-bearing
	stem, two or three metres in length, shrivels,
	but remains standing for some time. Its peripheral
	portion is hardened by the heat, while the sap in the
	interior almost entirely disappears. A hollow cylinder
	with a well-sheltered cavity is thus formed, and the
	<em lang="la" xml:lang="la">Colaptes</em> proposes to utilise it as a storehouse. His
	acorns will there be well protected against external
	influences and against the birds whose beaks are too
	weak to pierce the agave. It is then a question of filling
	<a class="pagenum" id="page90" title="90"> </a>the tube. The animal first pierces the wall towards
	the base of the stalk; through this hole he introduces
	acorns until he has filled the lower part of the cavity.
	This done, he makes a new hole rather above the
	first, and fills the interval between the two, continuing
	this process until he has arrived at the top of the
	stalk and filled the whole interior. (<a href="#fig10_11" id="fig10_11mark">Figs. 10 and 11.</a>)
	The bird seems at first to take unnecessary trouble
	by boring so many holes. He would reach his end as
	well, it would seem, by making a single hole at the
	top to fill his storehouse, and another at the bottom
	to empty it. But we must not thus accuse him of
	lack of judgment. The interior of the tube is just
	large enough for the passage of an acorn; but at
	certain points the sap is not entirely absorbed, and
	there might easily be an impediment which would
	leave a large part of the cavity empty. Hence the
	necessity for a number of openings. When the sun
	has scorched up plants, and provisions are rare, he
	turns to his barns of abundance. Now and every
	time that he has need he can utilise the method that
	has been employed by his cousin the <em lang="la" xml:lang="la">Melanerpes</em>.
	In order to feed on each acorn without too much
	trouble, or allowing it to slip from his beak, the bird
	places it in a vice. He hollows a hole in the trunk of
	a tree, introduces the fruit there forcibly, and eats it
	at his ease.<a href="#footnote_52" id="fnm52"  class="fnmarker">52</a></p>

	<p>The provisions collected by these two birds reveal
	a remarkable fact. They possess indeed two distinct
	diets; they do not preserve for the period of famine
	the overplus of the foods which they consume in the
	period of abundance. They chase insects and feed on
	<a class="pagenum" id="page92" title="92"> </a>them as long as they can find them, while they gather
	up in their storehouses an entirely different food.</p>

	<p><em lang="la" xml:lang="la">Physiological reserves.</em> — All the animals of which I
	have just spoken place their provisions for the future
	in barns in the same manner as Man. Those who
	have not this foresight are either able to nourish
	themselves in all seasons by the chase, or else, after
	having feasted one half of the year, they fast during
	the other half. In the latter case they consume
	during the fasting period a portion of their own substance,
	and use up materials placed in reserve in their
	organism, in the form of fat for example. This
	arrangement, which allows them to prolong life,
	though growing thin, until the next season of prosperity,
	is not under the control of the will. It is
	a complication of physiological phenomena resulting
	from the functioning of different parts of the
	organism.</p>

	<p><em id="ch_4_4" class="section_title">Stages between physiological reserves and provisions.</em> — Between
	physiological reserves and industrial stores
	we may place as an intermediate stage the interesting
	case of the Honey Ants.<a href="#footnote_53" id="fnm53"  class="fnmarker">53</a></p>

		<p class="caption"><a href="#fig12mark">Fig. 12.</a></p>
	</div>

	<p>These insects (<em lang="la" xml:lang="la">Myrmecocystus</em>) live in Texas, and
	form colonies in which certain individuals play a very
	special part They exaggerate to an extreme point
	the power of preserving provisions in their crops.
	These materials are not assimilated; they do not
	form part of the animal’s body, and although placed
	inside it cannot be compared to physiological
	reserves. It is especially curious that they are not to
	be utilised only by the animal itself, but also by the
	other members of the colony who are not able to form
	<a class="pagenum" id="page93" title="93"> </a>such stores. Among the <em lang="la" xml:lang="la">Myrmecocystus</em> there are
	workers of two sorts; the first kind resemble other
	ants with some differences of detail, and build and
	hollow the earth nest which shelters the community.
	The second kind is quite different; the
	abdomen in these workers is enormously distended
	so as to constitute a voluminous sphere, which may
	become four or five times larger than the thorax and
	head together. (<a href="#fig12" id="fig12mark">Fig. 12.</a>) On this distended receptacle
	appear several darker plates; these are the
	remains of the chitinous parts of the primitive wings.
	In the fine season these ants go out in a band and
	collect a sweet liquor
	which forms pearly
	drops on certain galls
	of oak leaves. These
	drops, elaborated into
	honey, gradually fill the
	crop, distending it and
	pushing back neighbouring
	organs until it
	receives its globular form. When they have arrived
	at this obese condition, the heavy honey ants no longer
	leave the nest. They remain without movement, hanging
	by their legs to the roof or lying against the walls
	of a room. The workers who have remained slender
	come and go, attending to their usual occupations, and
	pass near the others without paying attention to them
	or going out of the way to lend assistance to their
	impotent sisters when one of them has rolled over on
	the ground and can no longer arise unaided. (<a href="#fig13" id="fig13mark">Fig.
	13.</a>) They only cease to be indifferent when impelled
	by the selfish sentiment of hunger, and then it
	is to ask and not to give assistance. The fat ants in
	<a class="pagenum" id="page94" title="94"> </a>fact could not themselves consume all the honey that
	they have elaborated; the others in times of famine
	approach them, caress them with their antennæ, and
	obtain by solicitation a drop of honey which the large
	ones disgorge from the crop. Here, then, is a colony
	in which the division of labour has reached a remarkable
	degree of polymorphism. Some of the members
	accomplish the work of engineers and masons, while
	the others fabricate for the community a store of
	honey. Instead of depositing these provisions in
	cells like bees, they preserve them in their own
	digestive tube. This custom has re-acted to such an
	<a class="pagenum" id="page95" title="95"> </a>extent on the form of their bodies that at first sight
	they seem to belong to a different species.</p>

	<p><em id="ch_4_5" class="section_title">Animals who submit foods to special preparation in
	order to facilitate transport.</em> — Not content with collecting
	materials as they are found in nature, certain
	animals submit them to preparation with various
	aims, either to render transport easier or that they
	may not deteriorate when stored. Among those of
	whom I have just spoken, some collect with the view
	of utilising their stores in a more remote future than
	others. The <em lang="la" xml:lang="la">Ateucus sacer</em> intends to consume the
	provisions he prepares almost immediately. Yet he
	acts in so careful a manner that I cannot pass him in
	silence. This beetle is the sacred Scarabæus so
	venerated by the Egyptians, who have everywhere
	reproduced his image in porphyry and granite. He
	is a most singular insect. The celebrated Fabre has
	given a complete and very picturesque history of his
	customs.<a href="#footnote_54" id="fnm54"  class="fnmarker">54</a> I have myself had an opportunity of
	seeing him at work. It was in Persia, in the plain
	of Susiana, on a hot morning in March. We had
	passed the night in the open air, proposing to continue
	our journey in the early morning, but our mules,
	rendered rather lively by the fresh grass brought out
	by the spring weather, had decided otherwise. They
	had all decamped to take a ramble on their own
	account. In order to pass away the hours taken up
	by the muleteers in searching for the strayed animals,
	the Scarabæus would, I thought, furnish me with an
	amusing and instructive spectacle. During the night
	the mules had not failed to leave here and there the
	relics of their digestion. The aroma, borne on the
	morning breeze, had struck the Scarabæus on awaking.
	<a class="pagenum" id="page96" title="96"> </a>It was his favourite dish. From all points of
	the sky their heavy silhouettes could be seen against
	the blue. It was still fresh, the sun having only
	risen about an hour before; the heat would soon
	become oppressive, and the sybaritic beetle, without
	attending to his morning appetite, which his
	fresh meal could not fail to excite, nourishes the
	bourgeois dream of making his little pile in order to
	enjoy himself sheltered from the hot rays. Immediately
	on arriving on the scene of the accident each
	began to display feverish activity. All set to work.
	With their heads, the anterior edge of which is flat
	and supplied with six strong spines, they raised their
	provisions; with their anterior feet, which are large
	and also armed with spines, they moulded the paste
	and placed it beneath the abdomen between the four
	other legs, giving it a rounded form. Little by
	little the sphere increased and acquired the size of a
	small apple. That was sufficiently large, and besides
	it was already becoming hot. The insect set about
	carting away his prize to a sheltered dining-room.
	<a class="pagenum" id="page97" title="97"> </a>He placed his four posterior legs on the ball; with
	the two last, which were continually moving, he made
	certain of the equilibrium of the mass; then resting
	his head and two anterior feet on the ground he
	pushed backwards, and with extreme rapidity. (<a href="#fig14" id="fig14mark">Fig.
	14.</a>) There was enough for all; each worker could
	find the just reward for his labour; I witnessed none
	of the regrettable facts narrated by Fabre. It happens
	sometimes, according to this ingenious observer, that
	a cunning Scarabæus, who has taken no part in the
	laborious labour of moulding the paste, arrives when
	it is on the road to aid the convoy, or even simply to
	pretend to help, in order that when the moment has
	come he may claim a share in the coveted meal, or
	even carry it all away if he can profit by a momentary
	inattention on the part of the lawful proprietor. I
	followed one of these Coleoptera for more than five
	metres from the place where his labour began. After
	having deposited his ball he began to dig up the earth
	around it;<a href="#footnote_55" id="fnm55"  class="fnmarker">55</a> but the mules had returned and I was
	obliged to depart.</p>

	</div>

	<p>I have no doubt that subsequent events were not
	exactly the same as narrated by Fabre for the Scarabæus
	of Provence. The insect having made his hole,
	buries himself in it for a <em lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">tête à tête</em> with the precious
	sphere. He immediately sets about passing the
	whole through his body. Without haste but without
	rest, for a week or a fortnight, as long as
	there is any of it left, he eats continuously,
	and continuously digests. He does not stop for
	a moment, his jaws are working the whole time;
	and Fabre has called attention to the fact that
	<a class="pagenum" id="page98" title="98"> </a>from the opposite extremity of the animal a continuous
	thread emerges without breaking, and

	animals who take particular care of the provisions
	they have amassed, special mention must be made of
	certain species of Ants. It was formerly believed that
	these industrious Hymenoptera are not accustomed to
	store up in barns for the winter. This opinion long
	prevailed owing to the authority of Huber, so competent
	in these matters, although the ancients were
	well acquainted with the storehouses of ants.<a href="#footnote_56" id="fnm56"  class="fnmarker">56</a> But it
	was founded on an exclusive study of these insects in
	northern countries, in which, during the cold season,
	they become torpid and buried in their hybernal
	sleep. Naturally they have no need of food during
	this period, but it was incorrect to generalise from
	this fact. The ants of the south are active all the
	year round. An English naturalist, Moggridge, who
	passed several winters at Mentone, has placed this
	fact out of doubt. Suffering from an incurable disease,
	he occupied the last years of his life in observing and
	setting down for the instruction of others the habits
	of these insects. He found that ants of the species
	<em lang="la" xml:lang="la">Atta barbara</em> store up grains. They utilise plants of
	various kinds, but usually fumitory, oats, nettle, various
	species of <em lang="la" xml:lang="la">Veronica</em>, etc. They procure these grains
	towards the end of autumn, collecting them on the soil,
	or even, when they do not fall in sufficient quantities,
	climbing up the plants and gathering them in position.
	An ant will, for instance, ascend the stem of a fruiting
	plant, of shepherd’s-purse, let us say, and select a
	<a class="pagenum" id="page99" title="99"> </a>well-filled but green pod, mid-way up the stem, those
	below being ready to shed their seeds at a touch.
	Then seizing it in its jaws, and fixing its hind legs
	firmly as a pivot, it contrives to turn round and
	round, and so to strain the fibres of the fruit-stalk
	until they snap; it then patiently backs down the
	stem. Sometimes two ants combine their efforts;
	one, at the base of the peduncle, gnaws at the point of
	greatest tension, while the other hauls upon it and
	twists it. And sometimes the ants drop the capsules
	to their companions below, corresponding with the
	curious account given by Ælian of the way the spikelets
	of corn are thrown down “to the people below.”
	In this labour they display the activity usual in their
	race, and do not stop until they have carried away
	to their barns the amount of provision they desire.
	When their wealth is stored up in the nest, the ants
	pile up the grains in some hundred little rooms
	designed for this purpose, each measuring from seven
	to eight centimetres in diameter, and three or four in
	height; the average granary being about the size of
	a gentleman’s gold watch. Adding up the quantities
	of grain divided between these different barns, it is
	found that they may be estimated at about 500 or
	600 grammes, which represents a very large number
	of meals for such small appetites, and must cost
	colossal labour if we take into consideration the size
	of the workers. But when the harvest is completed,
	the <em lang="la" xml:lang="la">Atta barbara</em> have not completed their task; they
	are too ingenious to limit themselves to waiting with
	crossed legs for the moment to come when they may
	enjoy their labour, without considering the damage
	that may arise. Their first care is to prevent the grains
	from germinating for some weeks. How they obtain
	<a class="pagenum" id="page100" title="100"> </a>this result is not exactly known, but it is certain that
	germination does not take place, although all the
	conditions of heat and moisture offered by the interior
	of the ant-hill are favourable to it; it is not less certain
	that this arrest is due to the ants. This is shown in
	a very simple manner. It is sufficient to prevent the
	access of the insects to one of these chambers to cause
	the grains to germinate immediately. We can only
	suppose some direct action of the ants, every other
	hypothesis falling before this single fact: the arrested
	phenomenon is produced as soon as the <em lang="la" xml:lang="la">Atta barbara</em>
	no longer acts on it. Therefore they arrest germination
	without rendering it impossible, and when the
	moment arrives for utilising the accumulated stores,
	their first care is to allow the grains to follow the
	normal course of evolution. The envelope breaks,
	the little plant makes its appearance; radicle and
	stalk come to light. But the ants do not permit the
	development to go too far. The little plant, in order
	to grow, digests the starch which is associated with
	the albumen, for it is not yet able to draw its
	nourishment direct from the soil. To be absorbed
	and assimilated this starch must first be transformed
	into sugar. This chemical transformation being
	effected, the grain is in the condition in which the
	ants prefer it. Like a wine-grower who watches
	over the fermentation in his vat, and stops it before
	the wine turns sour, they stop the digestion of the
	starch at this stage. If we do not know how they
	retard germination, we know at all events how they
	render it impossible at this later stage. It is the
	young plant which absorbs the glucose, and which
	must therefore be destroyed; they cut off the radicle
	with their mandibles, and gnaw the stalk; the germ
	<a class="pagenum" id="page101" title="101"> </a>is thus suppressed. They have not yet finished their
	manipulations, which must enable them to preserve
	without further alteration the provisions which they
	have already rendered palatable. They bring out all
	their provisions to the sun, dry them, and take them
	back to the barns. As long as winter lasts they feed
	on this sweet flour. An anatomical peculiarity enables
	them to make the most of it; their mouth is so
	arranged that they can absorb solid particles and
	eat the albuminous powder. In this they differ from
	their northern kin, who are obliged to feed exclusively
	on juices.</p>

	<p>I have compared the labours of these ants to those
	of the wine-grower. Both of them in fact utilise the
	chemical phenomena going on in living matter; both
	of them know how at a given moment to prevent
	the transformation from going further. Neither
	of them for the rest take into account the part
	played by diastasis and ferments. The ancestors
	of one as of the other have by chance found out the
	method, and they transmit it from generation to
	generation.<a href="#footnote_57" id="fnm57"  class="fnmarker">57</a></p>

	<p><em id="ch_4_7" class="section_title">Agricultural Ants.</em> — The art of amassing stores is
	still more highly perfected by an Ant which inhabits
	North America. It is called the <em lang="la" xml:lang="la">Pogonomyrmex
	barbatus</em>, or, on account of its customs, the Agricultural
	Ant. It carries out a certain number of
	preparatory acts, and pushes foresight further than
	any other animal, since it looks after its property
	while still growing. It is grain which these insects
	collect, but only a single species of graminaceous
	grain. This choice leads them to spend great trouble
	<a class="pagenum" id="page102" title="102"> </a>on their preferred plant. They act in such a way
	that in the case of men we should say, purely and
	simply, that they were cultivating. The art of
	treating the earth with a view of augmenting the
	products which it yields is certainly of all the manifestations
	of human activity that which we should
	least expect to find among animals. It is, however,
	impossible otherwise to describe the conduct of
	Agricultural Ants. The field which they prepare is
	found in front of their ant-hill; it is a terrace in
	extent about a square metre or more; there they will
	allow no other plant to grow but that from which they
	propose to gather fruit. This latter (<em lang="la" xml:lang="la">Aristida stricta</em>)
	is rather like a grain of oats, and in taste resembles
	rice; in America it is called ant rice. This culture
	represents for these insects a much more important
	property than a wheat field for man. It is, in relation
	to their size, a forest planted with great trees, in comparison
	with which baobabs and sequoias are dwarfs.
	It is not known if the <em lang="la" xml:lang="la">Pogonomyrmex</em> sow their rice;
	Lincecum asserted that the ants actually sow the
	seeds, that he had seen the process going on year
	after year; “there can be no doubt,” he concludes,
	“of the fact that this particular species of grass is
	intentionally planted, and in farmer-like manner
	carefully divested of all other grasses and weeds
	during the time of its growth.”<a href="#footnote_58" id="fnm58"  class="fnmarker">58</a> McCook is not able
	to accept this unqualified conclusion. “I do not
	believe that the ants deliberately sow a crop, as
	Lincecum asserts, but that they have, for some reason,
	<a class="pagenum" id="page103" title="103"> </a>found it to their advantage to permit the <em lang="la" xml:lang="la">Aristida</em> to
	grow upon their disks, while they clear off all other
	herbage; that the crop is seeded yearly in a natural
	way by droppings from the plant, or by seeds cast out
	by the ants, or dropped by them; that the probable
	reason for protecting the <em lang="la" xml:lang="la">Aristida</em> is the greater convenience
	of harvesting the seed; but, finally, that
	there is nothing unreasonable, nor beyond the probable
	capacity of the emmet intellect, in the supposition
	that the crop is actually sown. Simply, it is the
	Scotch verdict — Not proven.”<a href="#footnote_59" id="fnm59"  class="fnmarker">59</a> However it may be,
	they certainly allow no other plant to grow in the
	neighbourhood of their grain, to withdraw the nourishment
	which they wish to reserve entirely for it.
	Properly speaking, they weed their field, cutting off
	with their jaws all the troublesome plants which
	appear above the soil. They pursue this labour very
	diligently, and no strange shoot escapes their investigations.
	Thus cared for, their culture flourishes,
	and at the epoch of maturity the grains are collected
	one by one and carried within. Like all harvesters,
	these Hymenoptera are at the mercy of a shower that
	may fall during the harvest. They are well aware
	that in this case their provisions would be damaged,
	and that they would run the risk of germination or
	decay in the barns. Therefore, on the first sunny
	day all the ants, as observed by Lincecum and
	Buckley, may be seen carrying their grains outside,
	only bringing them back when they have been
	thoroughly dried, and always leaving behind those
	that have sprouted.<a href="#footnote_60" id="fnm60"  class="fnmarker">60</a></p>

	<p><a class="pagenum" id="page104" title="104"> </a><em id="ch_4_8" class="section_title">Gardening Ants.</em> — The Leaf-cutting Ants (<em lang="la" xml:lang="la">Œcodoma</em>)
	of tropical America are often alluded to by
	travellers on account of their ravages on vegetation;
	and they are capable of destroying whole plantations
	of orange, mango, and lemon trees. They climb the
	tree, station themselves on the edge of a leaf and
	make a circular incision with their scissor-like jaws;
	the piece of leaf, about the size of a sixpence, held
	vertically between the jaws, is then borne off to the
	formicarium. This consists of low wide mounds, in
	the neighbourhood of which no vegetation is allowed,
	probably in order that the ventilation of the underground
	galleries may not be interfered with.</p>

	<p>For a long time there was considerable doubt as to
	the use to which the leaf-cutting ants put the leaves;
	some naturalists supposed they are used directly as
	food, others that the ants roof their underground
	dwellings with them. The question was set at rest by
	Fritz Müller, who observed these ants in Brazil,<a href="#footnote_61" id="fnm61"  class="fnmarker">61</a> and
	independently by Belt, who studied them in Nicaragua,
	and has written an interesting account of their
	proceedings.<a href="#footnote_62" id="fnm62"  class="fnmarker">62</a> The real use of the leaves is as manure
	on which to grow a minute species of fungus; these
	ants are, in reality, mushroom growers and eaters.
	Belt several times exposed the underground chambers
	to observation and found that they were always about
	three parts filled with “a speckled, brown, flocculent,
	spongy-looking mass of a light and loosely-connected
	substance.” Scattered throughout these masses were
	the pupæ and larvæ, together with the smallest
	division of workers who do not engage in leaf-carrying,
	but whose duties appear to be to cut up the
	<a class="pagenum" id="page105" title="105"> </a>leaves into small fragments and to care for the young.
	On examination the masses proved to be composed
	of “minutely sub-divided pieces of leaves, withered
	to a brown colour, and overgrown and lightly connected
	together by a minute white fungus that
	ramified in every direction throughout it.” That they
	do not eat the leaves themselves was shown by the
	fact that near the tenanted chambers were found
	deserted ones filled with the refuse of leaves that had
	been exhausted as manure, and which served as food
	for the larvæ of various beetles. There are numerous
	holes leading up from the underground chambers,
	and these are opened out or closed up, apparently in
	order to regulate the temperature below. Great care
	is also taken that the nest should be neither too dry
	nor too damp; if a sudden shower comes on the
	leaves are left near the entrance, and carried down
	when nearly dry; during very hot weather, on the
	other hand, when the leaves would be parched in a
	very short time, the ants only work in the cool of the
	day and during the night. Occasionally, inexperienced
	ants carry in grass and unsuitable leaves;
	these are invariably brought out again and thrown
	away.<a href="#footnote_63" id="fnm63"  class="fnmarker">63</a></p>

	<p><em id="ch_4_9" class="section_title">Domestic animals of Ants.</em> — Following through different
	species the perfection reached in the art of laying
	up provisions for the future, we have gradually arrived
	at methods resembling those of Man. But a foresight
	still greater and nearer to his is manifested by
	those ants who breed and keep near them animals of
	different species, not for the sake of their flesh, but
	for certain secretions, just as man utilises the milk
	<a class="pagenum" id="page106" title="106"> </a>of the cow or the goat. Ants have true domestic
	animals belonging to a variety of species, but the
	most widely spread are the <em lang="la" xml:lang="la">Claviger</em> and the Aphides
	or plant-lice. To keep these insects at their disposal,
	Hymenoptera act in various ways: some, who are a
	little experienced, are content to take advantage of a
	free aphis which chance may put in their way; others
	shut up their cattle in stables situated in the midst
	of the ant-hill, or else pen them in the country at a
	spot where they can best find their food. These facts
	have long since been carefully studied and leave no
	room for doubt.</p>

	<p>The <em lang="la" xml:lang="la">Claviger testaceus</em> is a small beetle, often
	met in the dwellings of ants. Nature has not been
	very generous on its behalf. It is blind, and its eyes
	are indeed altogether atrophied. The elytra are
	soldered at the median edge, so that it cannot spread
	its wings to fly. It is an animal predestined to the
	yoke; and for the rest its masters treat it with
	extreme kindness. The yellow ants, according to
	Müller,<a href="#footnote_64" id="fnm64"  class="fnmarker">64</a> have reduced this outcast beetle to domesticity,
	and it is almost a piece of good fortune
	for him to have lost his freedom and to have gained
	in exchange a shelter and a well-furnished trough.
	These insects are in fact cared for by their masters,
	who feed them by disgorging into their mouths the
	sweet liquids they have gathered here and there. If a
	nest is disturbed the ants hasten to carry their eggs and
	larvæ out of danger; they display the same solicitude
	with regard to the <em lang="la" xml:lang="la">Claviger</em>, and carefully bear them to
	the depth of their galleries. It must not be believed
	<a class="pagenum" id="page107" title="107"> </a>that the practical insect takes so much care in order
	to repair the injustice of nature towards the beetle;
	the part of a devoted sick nurse would not suit
	him; he cares for the <em lang="la" xml:lang="la">Claviger</em> because it is his
	property, a capital which brings in interest in the
	shape of excellent sweet little drops which are good
	to suck.<a href="#footnote_65" id="fnm65"  class="fnmarker">65</a></p>

	<p>A yellow ant, who wishes to enjoy the result
	of the cares given to his pensioner, approaches it
	and gently caresses it with his antennæ; the other
	shows signs of pleasure at this visit, and soon
	a pearly drop appears on the tuft of hairs at the
	edge of its elytra, and this the ant hastens to
	lick. The beetle is thus exploited and tickled by
	all the members of the community to which he
	belongs who meet him on their road. But when
	it has been milked two or three times it ceases to
	<a class="pagenum" id="page108" title="108"> </a>secrete. A solicitous ant arriving at this moment
	finds its efforts in vain, but still behaves like a good
	shepherd; it shows no impatience or anger towards
	its exhausted beast, knowing well that it is only necessary
	to come back a little later or to go to another
	member of the herd. Nor are his cares lessened by
	finding the source dried up. He foresees that it will
	still be good after repose, and if it is hungry he disgorges
	food for it.</p>

	<p><em id="ch_4_10" class="section_title">Degrees of civilisation in the same species of Ants.</em> — These
	facts are sufficiently marvellous in themselves,
	but are more surprising when we recollect that they
	cannot be regarded as an innate and unreflecting
	instinct with which all the individuals of the same
	species are endowed. The art of domesticating the
	<em lang="la" xml:lang="la">Claviger</em> is a stage of civilisation reached by some
	tribes and not by others. Lespès<a href="#footnote_66" id="fnm66"  class="fnmarker">66</a> has placed this
	out of doubt in the following manner. He had specimens
	of <em lang="la" xml:lang="la">Lasius niger</em> who exploited a flock of
	Coleoptera. Having met ants of the same species
	who possessed no flocks, he brought them some. At
	the sight of the little insects they threw themselves on
	them, killed them, and devoured them. If we compare
	these facts with those which pass in human societies,
	it will seem to us that these latter Hymenoptera
	behave like a horde of hunters in the presence of a
	flock of sheep, while the first have already arrived at
	the sheep-herding stage.</p>

	<p><em id="ch_4_11" class="section_title">Aphis-pens and paddocks.</em> — Ants can also keep
	Aphides in their homes. In this case, fearing that
	the adult beasts may not be able to adopt a change of
	surroundings and food, they bring the eggs to their
	<a class="pagenum" id="page109" title="109"> </a>nests and care for them at the same time as their own
	children. In time they come out and constitute a
	flock easy to tame. Other ants, still more intelligent,
	have discovered a method of holding the Aphides
	captive, while allowing them to enjoy their accustomed
	life, and to feed at will on the foods they prefer on
	their own favourite spots. It is sufficient for this
	purpose to establish barriers around a group of cattle
	who have themselves fixed the place of their sojourn.
	The <em lang="la" xml:lang="la">Lasius niger</em>, a skilful architect, constructs
	vaulted passages from his dwelling into the country.
	These covered roads, built with earth moistened with
	saliva, have various ends; some have been made in
	order to reach remote work sheltered from the sun,
	or to give concealment from enemies. Many lead to
	the pens of the Aphides; they reach from the anthill
	as far as the foot of a plant where these insects
	are abundant. In order to have their milkers at their
	disposal, without removing them from pasture, the
	ants make tunnels along the stalk, and enclose within
	it all the Aphides they meet. They thus prevent any
	desire for a distant ramble. But in order that the
	flock may not be too closely confined, the <em lang="la" xml:lang="la">Lasius
	niger</em> enlarge the galleries in places, and make a sort
	of chamber or stable in which the beasts may disport
	themselves at ease. These halls, which are proportionately
	very vast, are supported against the
	branches and leaves of the plant which bears up the
	walls and the vaults. The captives find themselves
	then with all the advantages of material life, and may
	be milked with every facility.<a href="#footnote_67" id="fnm67"  class="fnmarker">67</a></p>

	<p>An allied species of ant, the <em lang="la" xml:lang="la">Lasius brunneus</em>, lives
	<a class="pagenum" id="page110" title="110"> </a>almost entirely on the sweet secretion of large
	Aphides in the bark of oaks and walnut trees. The
	ants construct around these insects cabins made of
	fragments of wood, and wall them in completely so
	as to keep them at their own disposal.</p>

	<p>The <em lang="la" xml:lang="la">Myrmica</em> also forms similar pasture lands; its
	system is rather less perfect than that of the <em lang="la" xml:lang="la">Lasius</em>,
	as it does not form covered galleries to reach its
	stables. It is content to build large earth huts around
	a colony. A large hole, which allows the passage of
	the ants, but not the escape of the flock, is formed so
	that they may come to milk their cows. They use
	the same methods we have seen practised on the
	<em lang="la" xml:lang="la">Claviger</em>, caressing the insect with their antennæ
	until the sugared drop appears.<a href="#footnote_68" id="fnm68"  class="fnmarker">68</a></p>

	<p>An example is quoted which shows still greater
	intelligence and foresight in Ants. They have been
	known to repopulate their territories after an epidemic,
	or at least after the destruction of their Aphides.
	The proprietor of a tree, finding it covered with these
	exploited beasts, cleared it of its inconvenient guests by
	repeated washes; but the dispossessed Hymenoptera,
	considering that this pasture close to their nest was
	very convenient for a flock, resolved to repopulate it,
	and for some time these tenacious insects could be
	seen bringing back among the foliage Aphides
	captured elsewhere.<a href="#footnote_69" id="fnm69"  class="fnmarker">69</a></p>

	<p><a class="pagenum" id="page111" title="111"> </a><em id="ch_4_12" class="section_title">Slavery among Ants.</em> — The custom of making
	slaves is widely spread in the ant world; I have
	already described the expeditions organised to obtain
	them. We will now consider the relations of
	these insects among themselves.</p>

	<p>The <em lang="la" xml:lang="la">Formica sanguinea</em> takes possession of the
	eggs of the <em lang="la" xml:lang="la">Formica fusca</em> and rears them with its own.
	When the slaves reach the adult condition they live
	beside their masters and share their labours, for the
	latter work, are skilful in all tasks, and can by their
	own activity construct an ant-hill and keep it going.
	If they desire servants, it is not in order to throw all
	the work on them, but to have intelligent assistants.
	This is the primitive form of slavery as it first existed
	among men. It was not until later that it became
	modified, to become at last an institution against
	which the sentiment of justice arose. Other species
	of Ants have pushed the exploitation of slaves to a
	point Man has never reached. But the <em lang="la" xml:lang="la">Formica
	sanguinea</em> are companions to their helpers rather than
	masters, and even show them great consideration.
	When the colony emigrates one may see the owners
	of the nest, who are of larger size than the <em lang="la" xml:lang="la">Formica
	fusca</em>, take these up in their jaws and carry them the
	entire way.</p>

	<p>The Amazons (<em lang="la" xml:lang="la">Polyergus rufescens</em>) act otherwise.
	Very skilful in obtaining slaves and powerfully armed
	for triumphant raids, their nests always contain
	legions of servants, and the custom of being waited
	upon has become so impressed on the race by heredity
	that it is an instinct stronger even than personal preservation.
	The master ant has not only lost the taste
	and the idea of work, but even the habit of feeding
	himself, and would die of hunger beside a pile of
	<a class="pagenum" id="page112" title="112"> </a>honey or sugar if a grey ant was not there to put it into
	his mouth. Thus Huber, the earliest accurate observer
	of these ants, enclosed thirty Amazons with several
	pupæ and larvæ of their own species, and twenty
	negro pupæ, in a glass box, the bottom of which was
	covered with a thick layer of earth; honey was given
	to them, so that, although cut off from their auxiliaries,
	the Amazons had both shelter and food. At first
	they appeared to pay some little attention to the
	young; this soon ceased, and they neither traced out
	a dwelling nor took any food; in two days one-half
	died of hunger, and the other remained weak and languid.
	Commiserating their condition, he gave them
	<em>one</em> of their black companions. This little creature,
	unassisted, formed a chamber in the earth, gathered
	together the larvæ, put everything into complete
	order, and preserved the lives of those which were
	about to perish.</p>

	<p>All their industry is expended in the acquisition of
	captives. The <em lang="la" xml:lang="la">Polyergus</em> avoid introducing into their
	houses adults who would not become reconciled to
	the loss of liberty, and would prefer to die rather than
	work for others. They carry off the larvæ of <em lang="la" xml:lang="la">Formica
	fusca</em> and <em lang="la" xml:lang="la">Formica cunicularia</em>. When brought
	into the ant-hill these larvæ are placed in the jaws of
	slaves of their own species, who care for them; they
	are born captives, and have neither the regret nor the
	idea of a free life. Among the Amazons the slaves
	undertake every labour; it is they who build and who
	care for the larvæ of their masters, as well as those
	carried away in expeditions. They have also complicated
	personal services towards the <em lang="la" xml:lang="la">Polyergus</em>.
	They bring them food, lick off the dust from their
	hairs, clean them, carry them from one place to
	<a class="pagenum" id="page113" title="113"> </a>another, if there is need to emigrate, although they
	themselves are much smaller. The masters, by force
	of losing interest in work, lose also their votes when
	it is a question of taking a resolution concerning the
	whole colony. The servants act on their own initiative
	and their own responsibility, direct constructions
	according to their own ideas, and even in grave
	concerns, such as emigration, the idle masters do not
	seem to be consulted. The workers deliberate among
	themselves, and having come to a decision, proceed
	to execute it. They transport the household goods,
	the eggs, the future of the city, and the Amazons
	who have become its parasites. It is a most curious
	fact that the slaves should submit to this precarious
	fate when their masters are absolutely dependent on
	them. It is just to add that the robust mandibles of
	the latter may contribute to preserve the position they
	enjoy.<a href="#footnote_70" id="fnm70"  class="fnmarker">70</a></p>

	PROVISION FOR REARING THE YOUNG.</h2>

    OF THE SPECIES — FOODS MANUFACTURED

    VICTIMS.</p>

	<p><em id="ch_5_1" class="section_title">The preservation of the individual and the preservation
	of the species.</em> — In the previous chapter we have
	seen animals preparing for the future, and amassing
	materials for their own subsistence. In other cases
	these provisions are destined to feed the young. It is
	the same industry, sometimes exercised for the preservation
	of the individual, sometimes for the perpetuation
	of the race. We must expect to find acts
	of the last kind more instinctive and less reflective
	than those of the first, and this agrees well with what
	we know of natural selection. If we now see living
	beings display so many resources and calculate with
	such certainty all that will favour the healthy development
	<a class="pagenum" id="page115" title="115"> </a>of their descendants, we must not necessarily
	conclude that the species possess these instincts from
	the beginning. They are not to be regarded as
	mechanisms artfully wound up and functioning since
	the appearance of life on the earth with the same
	inevitable regularity. The qualities which we find in
	them were weak at first; they have developed in the
	course of ages, and have finally, by heredity, been
	impressed upon the creatures to manifest themselves
	by necessary acts from which there is no longer any
	escape. There is no need for surprise if we meet
	to-day, I do not say among all, but among a very
	large number of animals, this foresight for offspring
	in a well-marked form. It is easy to understand that
	the species that first acquired and fixed an instinct
	propitious to the increase of the race has rapidly
	prospered, stifling beneath its extension those that
	are less favoured from this point of view, which is of
	capital importance in a struggle for a place beneath
	the sun. At the present day if the struggle of animal
	life offers few facts of lack of foresight for the rearing
	of young, it is because this defect has killed the races
	who were subject to it; they have disappeared, or have
	only been saved by qualities of another order.</p>

	<p>For the rest, if it is difficult to reconstitute except
	in imagination the different stages through which, in
	time, and in a determined species, acts at first imperfect,
	but designed, have become perfect and
	instinctive, we can at least find in space different
	degrees of the same instinct in allied genera which
	lead us by a succession of transitions from mechanical
	action to reflective action.</p>

	<p>As I cannot quote all the facts showing this care
	for the future, I will select a few. It must be said at
	<a class="pagenum" id="page116" title="116"> </a>first that a considerable number of animals show
	nothing of the kind. Let us leave aside all the
	inferior beings to speak of those among whom we
	may expect some degree of method. Crustacea, fish,
	Batrachians, and many others lay their eggs, are
	contented to conceal them a little so that they may
	not become a too easy prey, and are altogether
	indifferent as to what may happen afterwards. As
	soon as they come out, the young obtain their own
	food from day to day; myriads are destroyed, and if
	the races remain so strong numerically it is because
	they are saved by the innumerable quantity of eggs
	produced by a single female. If it were not for this
	prodigious fecundity these species would have disappeared.
	Birds make no provision for their young;
	but, on the other hand, as long as the latter are weak
	and unable to obtain their own prey, the parents feed
	them every day by hunting both for themselves and
	the brood.</p>

	<p>I will not insist on those beings who, like mammals,
	produce physiological reserves, not for their own use,
	but for the profit of their young. The females of
	these animals elaborate materials from their own
	organism and store them up in the form of milk to
	nourish the young. This fact is related to foresight,
	with a view to offspring, exactly in the same way as
	the Honey Ants show a transformation of foresight for
	the individual. In both cases industry is replaced by
	the function of a specially adapted organ.</p>

	<p><em id="ch_5_2" class="section_title">Foods manufactured by the parents for the young.</em> — It
	is especially insects with whose industries
	we are here concerned, and they are more or less
	instinctive in various cases. Every one knows how
	the Hymenoptera prepare honey from the pollen of
	<a class="pagenum" id="page117" title="117"> </a>flowers, to some extent for themselves, but especially
	in order that their young may at the moment of
	appearance possess a food which will enable them
	to undergo their first metamorphosis sheltered from
	the inclemencies outside. These foods are enclosed
	with great art, according to the species, either in
	skilfully-constructed cells of wax, as by Bees, or in
	nests of paper or cardboard which the Wasps fabricate,
	or again in huts built of earth in the manner of the
	<em lang="la" xml:lang="la">Chalicodoma</em>.</p>

	<p><em id="ch_5_3" class="section_title">Species which obtain for their larvæ foods manufactured
	by others.</em> — Other insects have not this taste
	for lengthy labours, and do not know how to execute
	them; but they do not intend that their young shall
	be the victims of maternal lack of skill, and they
	display marvellous resources to enable them to profit
	by the foresight of others.</p>

	<p>The <em lang="la" xml:lang="la">Sitaris muralis</em>, a beetle whose customs
	have been described by Fabre in a remarkable
	manner,<a href="#footnote_71" id="fnm71"  class="fnmarker">71</a> may be counted among the cleverest in
	assuring to its larvæ the goods of others. It puts
	them in a position to profit by it, and when they are
	installed they know sufficiently well what to do.
	The species has so long perpetuated itself by this process
	that it has become, both in mother and offspring,
	highly automatic. It is a hymenopterous insect which
	this family, whose first vital manifestation is theft,
	thus levies a contribution on. It is called the <em lang="la" xml:lang="la">Anthophora
	pilifera</em>, and during the fine weather it makes a
	collection of honey intended to be absorbed by its
	<a class="pagenum" id="page118" title="118"> </a>own larvæ, if it had not the misfortune to be watched
	by one of these intriguing Coleoptera. Wherever in
	Provence there is a perpendicular wall, natural or
	artificial, a little cliff, a sloping ditch, or the wall of
	one of those caves which the people of the country
	use for putting their tools in, the <em lang="la" xml:lang="la">Anthophora</em> hollows
	out galleries, at the bottom of which he builds a
	certain number of chambers. He fills each of them
	with honey, places in it an egg which floats in the
	midst of this little lake of nectar, and closes it all up.
	The <em lang="la" xml:lang="la">Sitaris</em> covets this honey to nourish its offspring,
	and the chamber to shelter it. After having discovered
	one of the galleries of which I have spoken,
	the female <em lang="la" xml:lang="la">Sitaris</em> comes about the beginning of
	September to lay her eggs, which are numerous, being
	not generally fewer than two thousand. In the following
	month the larvæ appear; they are black, and
	swarm in a little heap mixed up with the remains of
	egg-shells. They vegetate in this condition for a
	long time, and may still be found there in May. At
	this period they have become more active, and, in
	order to complete their development, are thinking
	of profiting by their favourable situation near the
	entrance to a gallery of the Hymenoptera; when a male
	<em lang="la" xml:lang="la">Anthophora</em> comes within reach, two or three of them
	catch hold of him and climb on to his thorax. They
	maintain themselves there by clinging to the hairs.
	At the moment of fertilisation the male, thus burdened,
	comes in contact with the female; the coleopterous
	larvæ then pass on to her, so that, according to
	Fabre’s expression, the meeting of the sexes brings
	death and life to the eggs at the same time. Henceforth
	fixed on this laying insect, the little <em lang="la" xml:lang="la">Sitaris</em> remain
	quiet, and have only to wait; their future is assured.
	<a class="pagenum" id="page119" title="119"> </a>The <em lang="la" xml:lang="la">Anthophora</em> has made her chambers, and with
	the greatest care has filled each of them with honey.
	Then in the midst she deposits an egg, which remains
	floating on the surface like a little boat; when her
	task is accomplished, the mother passes to a new cell
	to confide to it another of her descendants. During
	this time the parasite larva hastily descends the
	abdominal hairs and allows itself to fall on the egg
	of the <em lang="la" xml:lang="la">Anthophora</em>, to be then borne upon it as
	upon a raft; its fall must take place at the precise
	instant which will enable it to embark without falling
	into the honey, in which just now it would be glued
	fast, and perish. This series of circumstances results
	only in the introduction of a single <em lang="la" xml:lang="la">Sitaris</em> into a
	chamber; the moment which must be profited by is
	too short for many of them to seize. If the female
	<em lang="la" xml:lang="la">Anthophora</em> carries others hidden in her hairs, they
	are obliged to await a new hatching to let themselves
	glide off. Thus enclosed with the egg of the <em lang="la" xml:lang="la">Anthophora</em>
	and its provision of honey, the larva has no
	other rival to fear, and may alone utilise the whole
	store. This parasitism has to such an extent become
	a habit with the species, that the larva’s organisation
	has become modified by it. At the moment when it
	falls into the cell it cannot feed on honey. It is
	indispensable for its development that it should first
	devour the egg on which it floats; it can at this
	period be nourished by no other food. In acting in
	this way it also frees itself from a voracious being
	who would require much food. This first repast lasts
	about eight days, at the end of which it undergoes
	a moult, takes another form, and begins to float on
	the honey, gradually devouring it, for at this stage
	it becomes able to assimilate honey. Slowly its
	<a class="pagenum" id="page120" title="120"> </a>development is completed, with extremely interesting
	details with which we need not now concern ourselves.
	The larva of <em lang="la" xml:lang="la">Sitaris</em> is then in conditions
	exceptionally favourable for growth; but, in spite
	of appearances, there is no reason for admiring the
	marvellous foresight and extraordinary sureness of
	instinct; nearly everything depends on a fortuitous
	circumstance, a chance. This becomes very evident
	if we study another related beetle; it is called
	the <em lang="la" xml:lang="la">Sitaris colletis</em>, and lives at the expense of the
	hymenopterous <em lang="la" xml:lang="la">Colletes</em>, as its relative at the
	expense of the <em lang="la" xml:lang="la">Anthophora</em>. But these two species
	of the same genus are very unequally aided by
	chance. The one whose history we have just traced
	attaches itself to an insect whose egg floats above a store
	of honey; the second chooses a victim who attaches
	its egg to the walls of a chamber. (<a href="#fig15" id="fig15mark">Fig. 15.</a>) This
	almost insignificant difference has a considerable
	influence on the parasite’s evolution. In the first case
	it is alone, and may develop with certainty; in the
	second, on the contrary, several <em lang="la" xml:lang="la">Sitaris</em> penetrate the
	<a class="pagenum" id="page121" title="121"> </a>chamber and climb up to attack the egg, which in this
	case also must be their first food. This rivalry
	causes a struggle to the death. If one of the larvæ
	is notably more vigorous than its rivals, it may free
	itself from them and survive. Let us consider the
	fate in store for the two species. The first is much
	more favoured, since a happy chance permits each
	germ to produce an individual; in the second, each
	individual which completes its evolution deprives
	several of its brothers of life. And even this only
	happens in the most favourable cases, for it may be
	that not one <em lang="la" xml:lang="la">Sitaris</em> in the chamber may reach the
	adult state. If the first arrival begins to absorb the
	egg of the <em lang="la" xml:lang="l">Colletes</em>, a second hungry one may kill it
	in the midst of its repast and take its place. But the
	conqueror finds the provisions already reduced and
	insufficient to enable it to reach the moulting stage,
	at the end of which it could profit by the honey.
	Ill-nourished and weakened, it cannot support this
	crisis, and its corpse falls beside that of its fellow whom
	it had sacrificed. Three or four parasites may thus
	succeed to the same feast, and the victory of the last
	is useless to him. His first struggle for life and his
	first triumph are followed by irreparable defeat.
	These two examples show very well how a slight
	difference may favour a species, and how a happy
	quality is capable of being perpetuated by heredity,
	since by its very nature it is destined to be extended
	to more numerous beings.</p>

	<p><em id="ch_5_4" class="section_title">Carcasses of animals stored up.</em> — These insects lay
	up for their offspring stores manufactured by themselves
	or by others. The class we are now about to
	consider makes provision of animals either dead or in
	a torpid condition, with more or less art and more or
	<a class="pagenum" id="page122" title="122"> </a>less sure instinct. Most people have seen the <em lang="la" xml:lang="la">Necrophorus</em>
	or Burying Beetle working in fields or gardens.
	These are large Coleoptera who feed on abandoned
	carrion; everything is good to them — bodies of small
	mammals, birds, or frogs; they are very easy to please,
	and as long as the beast is dead that is all they
	require. When they have found such remains, and
	consider only how to satisfy their hunger, they do
	not take much trouble, and gnaw the prey on the
	spot where they have found it. They are not alone
	at the feast, and in spite of their diligence numerous
	rivals come up to dispute it; it is necessary to share
	with a great number of noisy and voracious flies and
	insects. In the adult state they come out well from
	this competition; but as good parents they wish to
	save their larvæ from it, as in a feeble condition these
	might suffer severely. They desire to lay up a carcass
	for their young alone, and with this object they bury
	it in the earth. The eggs also which will thus develop
	in the soil have more chance of escaping destruction
	by various insectivorous animals. If these diggers
	find a rat (<a href="#fig16" id="fig16mark">Fig. 16</a>) or a dead bird, three or four unite
	their efforts, glide beneath it, and dig with immense
	activity, kicking away with their hind legs the earth
	withdrawn from the hole. They do not pause, and
	their work soon perceptibly advances. The rat
	gradually sinks in the pit as it grows deeper. When
	they have the good fortune to find the earth soft they
	can sink the prey in less than two hours to a depth
	of thirty centimetres. At this level they stop, and
	throw back into the hole the earth they have dug
	out, carefully smoothing the hillock which covers the
	grave. Thus stored up, the carcass is ready to receive
	the <em lang="la" xml:lang="la">Necrophorus</em> eggs. The females enter the soil and
	<a class="pagenum" id="page123" title="123"> </a>lay on the buried mammal; then they retire, satisfied
	to leave their
	little ones, when
	they appear, face
	to face with
	such abundant
	nourishment.
	When they
	emerge from the
	envelope the
	young larvæ
	find themselves
	in the presence
	of this stored
	food, which has
	been softened
	by putrefaction
	and rendered
	more easy of
	digestion. If the
	treasure has not
	fallen on a spot
	easy to dig, the
	<em lang="la" xml:lang="la">Necrophorus</em>
	quickly recognise
	the fact, and
	do not waste
	time in useless
	labour. Endowed
	with
	considerable
	strength relatively
	to their
	size, three or four of them creep beneath the prey,
	<a class="pagenum" id="page124" title="124"> </a>and co-ordinating their efforts they transport it
	several metres off to a spot which they know by
	experience to be suitable for their labours. It may
	happen that soft earth is too far away, and transport
	becoming too difficult a task, they renounce it. But
	as good food should never be wasted, they utilise it
	by feeding themselves, awaiting a more manageable
	god-send for their offspring.</p>

	</div>

	<p>Many observers have studied these beetles, and
	all are surprised at their sagacity, and the way in
	which their various operations are adapted to circumstances;
	genuine reflection governs their acts,
	which are always combined to produce a definite
	effect.</p>

	<p><em id="ch_5_5" class="section_title">Provision of paralysed living animals.</em> — It is unnecessary
	to say how much better it would be for
	the young larva to have at its disposal instead of a
	carcass a living animal, but paralysed and rendered
	motionless by some method. It is difficult to believe
	the thing possible, yet nothing is better established.
	There is a hymenopterous relative of the Wasp called
	the <em lang="la" xml:lang="la">Sphex</em>. Instead of laying up honey they store
	animal provisions for their larvæ. Fabre has studied
	one of them, the <em lang="la" xml:lang="la">Sphex flavipennis</em>.<a href="#footnote_72" id="fnm72"  class="fnmarker">72</a> It is in September
	that this wasp lays her eggs; during this month
	to shelter her little ones she hollows out a dozen
	burrows and provisions them. She has then to
	devote about three days’ work to each of them, for
	there is much to do, as may be imagined. For
	each of these hiding-places the <em lang="la" xml:lang="la">Sphex</em> first pierces
	a horizontal gallery about two or three inches long;
	then she bends it obliquely so that it penetrates
	<a class="pagenum" id="page125" title="125"> </a>deeply into the earth, and it is again continued in
	this direction for about three inches. At the end of
	this passage three or four chambers are made, usually
	three; each of these is meant to receive one egg.
	The insect interrupts its mining task, not forming
	the three chambers consecutively; when the
	first is completed she provisions it — we shall soon see
	in what manner — and lays an egg there; then she
	blocks it up, suppressing all communication between
	this cell and the gallery; this done she bores a second
	passage, provisions it, and lays another egg, closes up
	the orifice, and proceeds to prepare the third. This
	work is pushed on with great activity, and when
	completed the <em lang="la" xml:lang="la">Sphex</em> entirely fills up the subterranean
	passage, and completely isolates the hope of
	the race at a depth sufficient to shelter it well. A
	last precaution is taken: before leaving, the rubbish
	in front of the obstructed opening is cleared away,
	and every trace of the operation disappears. The
	nest is then definitely abandoned, and another one
	prepared.</p>

	<p>The chambers in which the larvæ are enclosed — hastily
	made with little care, and with rough unsmoothed
	walls — are not very solid, and could not last
	long without slipping; but as they only have to last
	for a single season they possess sufficient resistance for
	the insect’s purpose. The larva also knows very well
	how to protect itself against the roughness of the
	walls, and overlays them with a silky secretion produced
	by its glands.</p>

	<p>We have now to consider the nature of the provisions
	placed by the <em lang="la" xml:lang="la">Sphex</em> near the egg. Each cell
	must contain four crickets. That is the amount of
	food necessary for a larva during its evolution, and
	<a class="pagenum" id="page126" title="126"> </a>these insects are in fact large enough to supply a
	considerable amount of nourishment. When the
	<em lang="la" xml:lang="la">Sphex</em> interrupts digging operations it is to fly on
	a hunting expedition. It soon returns with a cricket
	it has seized, holding it by one antenna which it turns
	round in its jaws. It is a heavy burden for the slender
	<em lang="la" xml:lang="la">Sphex</em> to bear. Sometimes on foot, dragging its
	burden after it, sometimes flying, and carrying the
	suspended cricket always in a passive condition,
	the burrow is gradually reached, not without difficulty.
	In spite of appearances, the cricket is not dead; it
	cannot move, but if kept for several days it will not
	putrefy, and its joints remain supple. It is simply the
	victim of a general paralysis.</p>

	<p><em id="ch_5_6" class="section_title">The cause of the paralysis.</em> — It was evidently of the
	greatest interest to know how the <em lang="la" xml:lang="la">Sphex</em> contrived
	this capture, and what method it used to suppress the
	movements of the prey. In order to obtain the
	solution of this problem, Fabre during a long period
	accumulated experiments and observations, and at
	last discovered in every detail how the thing was done.
	In order to compel the <em lang="la" xml:lang="la">Sphex</em> to act in his presence, he
	placed himself in front of the orifice of a gallery in which
	the insect was working; he soon saw it returning
	with a paralysed cricket. Arrived at the burrow,
	the insect placed the prey on the ground for a moment
	and disappeared in the passage to see that everything
	was in order, and that no damage had taken place
	since its departure. Everything was going well, and
	it reappeared, took up its burden, and again entered
	the subterranean passage, drawing the victim along.
	It brought it into the chamber for which it was
	destined, placing it on its back, the head down and
	the feet towards the door. Then it set out hunting
	<a class="pagenum" id="page127" title="127"> </a>again until it had ranged four crickets side by side.
	Before attempting a decisive experiment, the observer
	felt his way. At the moment when the <em lang="la" xml:lang="la">Sphex</em> was
	buried in the earth examining the chamber, Fabre
	withdrew the prey a short distance and awaited events.
	Having made the domiciliary visit, the <em lang="la" xml:lang="la">Sphex</em> then
	went straight to the place where it had left its insect,
	but could not find it. It was naturally very perplexed,
	and examined the neighbourhood with extreme agitation,
	not knowing what had happened, and evidently
	regarding the whole affair as very extraordinary; at
	last it found the victim it was seeking. The cricket
	still preserved the same immobility; its executioner
	seized it by an antenna and drew it anew to the
	entrance of the hole. In the interior of the subterranean
	domain everything is in good order; the insect
	had just assured itself of the fact, and we should
	expect to see it enter with its prey; not at all, it
	entered alone, and only decided to introduce the prey
	after it had made a fresh inspection. This fact is
	surprising, and it is still more surprising that if the
	practical joke of removing the cricket is repeated
	several times in succession, the <em lang="la" xml:lang="la">Sphex</em> drags it anew
	every time to the entrance of the burrow and first
	descends alone; forty times over this experiment
	succeeded without the insect deciding to renounce the
	habitual manœuvre. Fabre insists on this fact, and
	rightly, for nothing should be neglected; he makes it
	a text to show how automatic instinct is, and how the
	acts which proceed from it are invariably regulated so
	as to succeed one another always in the same order.
	In their nature these acts are quite indistinguishable
	from intelligent acts; only the creature is not capable
	of modifying them to bring them into harmony with
	<a class="pagenum" id="page128" title="128"> </a>unforeseen circumstances. All this is correct, but
	where it becomes excessive is in endowing animals
	alone with instinct and separating them from this
	point of view from Man. It is incontestable that the
	custom of visiting the burrow before introducing a
	victim into it has become so imperious in the <em lang="la" xml:lang="la">Sphex</em>
	that it cannot be broken, even when it is of no use.
	It is a mechanical instinct. But we may see an
	exactly parallel manifestation of human intelligence.
	In face of danger man utters cries of distress; they
	are heard and assistance comes. But these appeals
	are not intelligent and appropriate to the end; they
	are instinctive. Place the same individual in a situation
	where he knows very well that his voice cannot be
	heard; this will not hinder him from reproducing the
	same acts if he finds himself in the presence of danger.
	It is thus that the <em lang="la" xml:lang="la">Sphex</em> proceeds, guided by instincts,
	and it is no reason for despising it. And even in the
	course of this little experiment the insect gives proof
	of judgment. When it finds its cricket, it is perfectly
	aware that it is the same cricket which it brought,
	that there is no life in it, and that there is no need to
	re-commence the struggle; it sees too that it is not
	an ordinary corpse liable to putrefaction, but the very
	same cricket, and it does not hesitate to utilise it
	at once.</p>

	<p>These habits being ascertained, Fabre proceeded to
	find out how the paralysis is produced. He awaited
	near a burrow the <em lang="la" xml:lang="la">Sphex’s</em> arrival, dragging a victim
	by an antenna, and while the insect was occupied in
	the subterranean survey he substituted a living
	cricket for that which the <em lang="la" xml:lang="la">Sphex</em> had left, expecting
	to find it on the spot where it had been placed.
	On emerging it perceives the cricket scampering
	<a class="pagenum" id="page129" title="129"> </a>away; not a moment was to be lost, and without
	reflection it leapt on the refractory victim. A lively
	struggle followed, a duel to the death among the
	blades of grass; it was a truly dramatic spectacle,
	the agile assailant whirling around the Cricket,
	who kicked violently with his hind legs. If a blow
	were to reach the <em lang="la" xml:lang="la">Sphex</em> it would be disembowelled;
	but it avoids the blows skilfully without
	ceasing its own violent attack. At last the combat
	ends; the cricket is brought to earth, turned on to its
	back, and maintained in this position by the <em lang="la" xml:lang="la">Sphex</em>.
	Still on its guard, the latter seizes in its jaws one of
	the filaments which terminate the abdomen of the
	vanquished, placing its legs on the belly; with the
	two posterior legs it holds the head turned back so as
	to stretch the under side of the neck. The cricket is
	unable to move and the conqueror’s sting wanders
	over the horny carapace seeking a joint, feeling for a
	soft place in which it can enter to give the finishing
	stroke. The dart at last reaches, between the head and
	the neck, the spot where the hard portions articulate,
	leaving between them a space without covering. The
	joint in the armour is found. The <em lang="la" xml:lang="la">Sphex’s</em> abdomen
	is agitated convulsively; the sting penetrates the
	skin, piercing a ganglion situated just beneath this
	point; the venom spreads and acts on the nervous
	cells, which can no longer convey messages to the
	muscles. That is not all; the sting wanders over
	the cricket’s belly, this time seeking the joint
	between the neck and the thorax; it finds it,
	and is again thrust in with fury; a second ganglion
	of the nervous chain is thus perforated and poisoned.
	After these two wounds the victim is completely
	paralysed.</p>

	<p><a class="pagenum" id="page130" title="130"> </a>As already mentioned, several facts enable us to
	recognise that the Cricket is by no means dead.
	It is simply incapable of movement, as would happen
	after an injection of curare. This poison kills a
	superior animal, for it hinders the muscular movements
	of the chest and diaphragm, necessary to
	respiration; but if a frog, which can breathe through
	its skin, is thus acted on it comes to life again at the
	end of twenty-four or forty-eight hours if the dose
	has not been too strong. The cricket is in a similar
	condition; it neither eats nor breathes; being incapable
	also of movement, there is no vital expenditure;
	it remains in a sort of torpor, or latent life,
	awaiting the tragic fate that is reserved for it. When
	it has been deposited in the little mortuary chamber
	the <em lang="la" xml:lang="la">Sphex</em> lays an egg on its thorax. The larva will
	soon come out to penetrate the body of the prey by
	enlarging the hole left by the sting. It thus finds
	for its first meals a food which unites the flavour
	of living flesh with the immobility of death. Nothing
	can be more convenient. When the first body is
	eaten it proceeds to the second, and thus devours
	successively the four victims stored up by maternal
	foresight.</p>

	<p>In order not to interrupt the description and interfere
	with the succession of the acts, I have passed
	without remark the experiment in which Fabre
	substituted a living animal for the <em lang="la" xml:lang="la">Sphex’s</em> already
	paralysed captive. It seems to me, however, that in
	this circumstance the insect showed judgment, and
	knew how to act in accordance with new requirements.
	It was evidently the first time in insect
	memory in which so surprising a phenomenon had
	been seen as a victim at the last moment again taking
	<a class="pagenum" id="page131" title="131"> </a>the field. We cannot make instinct intervene here.
	If the <em lang="la" xml:lang="la">Sphex’s</em> acts are so automatic as we are sometimes
	led to believe, in accordance with facts which
	are perfectly accurate, we ought always to observe the
	following succession of acts: first, hollowing of the
	burrow; second, the chase; third, the blows of the dart;
	fourth, the different manœuvres for placing the victim
	in the sarcophagus. Now in the present case the insect
	had accomplished the first three series of actions, and
	had even begun the fourth; it ought next to drag the
	cricket into the burrow without listening to the
	recriminations which the latter had no business to
	make, since it was to be regarded as having received
	the two routine doses of poison. But the <em lang="la" xml:lang="la">Sphex</em> sees
	its victim come to life, understands this fact, and
	without seeking to fathom the cause judges that a
	new struggle and new blows of the sting are necessary;
	he understands that it is necessary to begin
	afresh, since the usual result has not been attained.
	He is then capable of reflection, and the series of acts
	which he accomplishes are not ordained with such
	inflexibility that it is impossible for him to modify
	them in order to conform them to varying circumstances.</p>

	<p>The <em lang="la" xml:lang="la">Sphex occitanica</em> acts in the same manner as
	its relative in this complicated art of laying up provisions
	for the family. The differences are only in
	detail. Instead of hollowing the burrow first and
	then setting out on the chase to fill it, it does not devote
	itself to the labour of digging until a successful
	expedition has already assured the victim. (<a href="#fig17" id="fig17mark">Fig. 17.</a>)
	Instead of attacking crickets it seeks a larger orthopterous
	insect, the <em lang="la" xml:lang="la">Ephippigera</em>. The struggle is no
	doubt more difficult, but the result is proportionately
	<a class="pagenum" id="page132" title="132"> </a>greater, and the pursuit does not need to be so often
	renewed; a single captive is sufficient for its larva.<a href="#footnote_73" id="fnm73"  class="fnmarker">73</a></p>

	<p><em id="ch_5_7" class="section_title">The sureness
	of instinct.</em> — It
	is not
	doubtful that
	a sure inherited
	instinct
	conducts the
	<em lang="la" xml:lang="la">Sphex</em> to
	prick its victim
	in the
	situation of
	the nervous
	ganglia,
	which will be
	wounded in
	the act. It
	may be said
	that the lesion
	results
	from the position
	in which
	the hymenopterous
	insect
	maintains its
	victim; for
	the sting is
	on the median
	line, and
	can only
	<a class="pagenum" id="page133" title="133"> </a>penetrate at the soft points; the two points attacked
	are then rigorously determined by physical circumstances.
	But these arguments have no bearing if we
	consider the method of procedure adopted by the
	<em lang="la" xml:lang="la">Ammophila</em>,<a href="#footnote_74" id="fnm74"  class="fnmarker">74</a> a hymenopterous insect related to the
	preceding, which paralyses caterpillars. It is free in this
	case to insert its sting at any portion of the body; yet
	it knows how to turn over and arrange the captive so
	that the dart shall penetrate both times at two points
	where ganglia will be poisoned and immobility without
	death be induced. It must then be agreed that
	there is here an instinct much too sure to be called
	mechanical; but these facts, which considered alone
	seem simply marvellous, become much less so, and
	lend themselves to evolutionary interpretation, when
	it is recognised that they are related by insensible
	degrees to other facts of the same order, much more
	intelligent and at the same time less sure.</p>

	<p><em id="ch_5_8" class="section_title">Similar cases in which the specific instinct is less
	powerful and individual initiative greater.</em> — Here is,
	for instance, the case of the <em lang="la" xml:lang="la">Chlorion</em>, where each
	animal possesses more considerable initiative.<a href="#footnote_75" id="fnm75"  class="fnmarker">75</a> It
	attacks the Cockroach. These insects are of an
	extremely varied size, according to age, and as they
	are also very agile the <em lang="la" xml:lang="la">Chlorion</em> is not certain of
	being always able to obtain victims of the same
	dimension. The orifice of its burrow, which it
	hollows in walls between the crevices of the stones,
	is calculated on the average size of its victims. It
	has also the habit of paralysing the cockroach by
	<a class="pagenum" id="page134" title="134"> </a>stinging it on the nervous chain. These preliminary
	operations do not impede it, but it is embarrassed
	when it wishes to introduce through the entrance of
	its gallery an insect which is too large. It pulls at
	first as much as it can, but seeing the failure of its
	efforts it does not persevere in this attempt, and
	comes out to survey the situation. Decidedly the
	victim is too large and cannot pass through. The
	<em lang="la" xml:lang="la">Chlorion</em> begins by cutting off the elytra, which
	maintain it rigid and prevent it from being compressed.
	This done, it harnesses itself anew and re-commences
	its efforts. But this is not sufficient, and the victim
	still resists. The insect returns, and again examines
	the situation. Now it is a leg which is placed cross-ways
	and opposes the introduction of the body;
	strong diseases need strong remedies, and our
	<em lang="la" xml:lang="la">Chlorion</em> sets itself to amputate this encumbering
	appendage. It triumphs at last; the cockroach
	yields to its efforts, and little by little penetrates the
	hole. As may be seen, the labour is laborious and
	painful, and may present itself beneath various aspects
	which call for a certain ingenuity on the part of the
	animal.</p>

	<p>Up to recent years the <em lang="la" xml:lang="la">Cerceris</em> was considered to
	act with as much certainty as the <em lang="la" xml:lang="la">Sphex</em>, and to obey
	an infallible instinct which always guided it for the
	best in the interests of its offspring. The insects it
	attacks belong to the genus <em lang="la" xml:lang="la">Buprestis</em>. It consumes
	them in considerable numbers. Its manner of action,
	as described by Léon Dufour,<a href="#footnote_76" id="fnm76"  class="fnmarker">76</a> much resembles that
	of the <em lang="la" xml:lang="la">Sphex</em>, and it would be superfluous to describe
	it. The only fact which I wish to mention, and
	<a class="pagenum" id="page135" title="135"> </a>which has been put out of doubt by the illustrious
	naturalist, is this: the <em lang="la" xml:lang="la">Buprestis</em> are paralysed, not
	dead; all the joints of the antennæ and legs remain
	flexible and the intestines in good condition. He
	was able to dissect some which had been in a state of
	lethargy for at least a week or a fortnight, although,
	under normal conditions, these insects in summer
	decay rapidly, and after forty-eight hours cannot be
	used for anatomical purposes. Another observer,
	Paul Marchal, took up this question afresh, and the
	results which he obtained seemed to indicate an
	instinct much less firm than earlier studies tended
	to show.<a href="#footnote_77" id="fnm77"  class="fnmarker">77</a></p>

	<p><em id="ch_5_9" class="section_title">Genera less skilful in the art of paralysing victims.</em> — These
	researches show us that in the <em lang="la" xml:lang="la">Cerceris</em> instinct
	is still subject to defect. In some neighbouring genera
	we can seize it, as it were, in process of formation.
	The way in which the <em lang="la" xml:lang="la">Bembex</em>, or Sand Wasp, provisions
	burrows by maternal foresight is much less
	mechanical than that of the <em lang="la" xml:lang="la">Sphex</em>. It is again Fabre
	who has described with most care the customs of
	this hymenopterous insect.<a href="#footnote_78" id="fnm78"  class="fnmarker">78</a> It hollows out for each
	egg a chamber communicating with the air by a
	gallery, and performs this work with little care and
	very roughly. Less skilful than the others, it does
	not amass at once all the provisions which its larvæ
	will need during the period of evolution. When the
	offspring has absorbed the last prey brought, it is
	necessary to bring a new victim. This insect is
	scarcely more advanced than birds, who feed their
	young from day to day. And it is a great labour to
	re-open every time the gallery which leads to the
	<a class="pagenum" id="page136" title="136"> </a>nursery; on all these visits, in fact, the <em lang="la" xml:lang="la">Bembex</em> fills
	it up on leaving, and causes the disappearance of
	all revealing traces. It is obliged to take so much
	trouble, because it has not inherited from its ancestors
	the receipt for the paralysing sting; it throws itself
	without care on its victim, delivers a few chance
	blows, and kills it. Necessarily it cannot, under
	these conditions, lay up provisions for the future;
	they would corrupt, and the larvæ would not be
	benefited; hence the obligation of frequently returning
	to the nest, and of a perpetual hunt to feed
	descendants whom nature has gifted with an excellent
	appetite. According to the age of the offspring, the
	mother chooses prey of different sizes; at first she
	brings small Diptera; then, when it has grown, she
	captures for it large blow-flies, and lastly gadflies.<a href="#footnote_79" id="fnm79"  class="fnmarker">79</a> It
	will be seen, then, that if we suppose the instinct of the
	<em lang="la" xml:lang="la">Sphex</em> to be slowly developed by being derived from
	a sting given at random, we make a supposition
	which is quite admissible and rests on ascertained
	facts. However this may be, the <em lang="la" xml:lang="la">Bembex</em>, returning
	to its burrow, is able to find it again with marvellous
	certainty, in spite of the care taken to hide it by
	removing every trace that might reveal its existence.
	It is guided by an extraordinary topographic instinct,
	which men not only do not possess, but cannot even
	understand the nature of.</p>

	<p>It would appear that certain Hymenoptera, fearing
	to kill their victim with the sting, and not knowing
	<a class="pagenum" id="page137" title="137"> </a>the art of skilful lesions, attempt to immobilise them
	by wounds of another sort. This is the case with the
	<em lang="la" xml:lang="la">Pompilius</em>, according to Goureau,<a href="#footnote_80" id="fnm80"  class="fnmarker">80</a> who has studied it.
	This insect nourishes its larvæ with spiders; it seems
	certain that in most cases the spider is not pricked.
	Victims who have been taken from the interior of
	provision burrows can live for a long time in spite of
	their wounds; they cannot, therefore, have received
	venom by inoculation. The author already quoted
	believes that the Pompilius seizes its captive by
	the pedicle which unites the abdomen to the cephalothorax,
	and that it triturates this point between its
	jaws. From this either death or temporary immobility
	may follow. The <em lang="la" xml:lang="la">Pompilius</em> also makes up
	for its relative ignorance by considerable ingenuity.
	Thus sometimes, when it fears a return to life of the
	victim destined for its larvæ, it cuts off the legs while
	it is still passive. Goureau has found in the nest of
	this insect living spiders with their legs cut off.</p>

	<p class="first_paragraph"><span class="first_word">Animals</span> construct dwellings either to protect
	themselves from the cold, heat, rain, and other chances
	of the weather, or to retire to at moments when the
	search for food does not compel them to be outside
	and exposed to the attacks of enemies. Some inhabit
	<a class="pagenum" id="page139" title="139"> </a>these refuges permanently; others only remain there
	during the winter; others, again, who live during the
	rest of the year in the open air set up dwellings to
	bring forth their young, or to lay their eggs and rear
	the offspring. Whatever the object may be for which
	these retreats are built, they constitute altogether
	various manifestations of the same industry, and I
	will class them, not according to the uses which they
	are to serve, but according to the amount of art
	displayed by the architect.</p>

	<p>In this series, as in those which we have already
	studied, we shall find every stage from that of beings
	provided for by nature, and endowed with a special
	organ which secretes for them a shelter, up to those
	who are constrained by necessity to seek in their own
	intelligence an expedient to repair the forgetfulness
	of nature. These productions, so different in their
	origin, can only be compared from the point of view
	of the part they play; there are analogies between
	them but not the least homology.</p>

	<p><em id="ch_6_1" class="section_title">Animals naturally provided with dwellings.</em> — Nearly
	all the Mollusca are enveloped by a very hard calcareous
	case, secreted by their mantle: this shell, which
	is a movable house, they bear about with them and
	retire into at the slightest warning.</p>

	<p>Caterpillars which are about to be transformed into
	chrysalides weave a cocoon, a very close dwelling in
	which they can go through their metamorphosis far
	from exterior troubles. It is an organic form of
	dwelling, or produced by an organ. It is not necessary
	to multiply examples of this kind; they are extremely
	numerous. In the same category must be ranged
	the cells issuing from the wax-glands which supply
	Bees with materials for their combs in which they
	<a class="pagenum" id="page140" title="140"> </a>enclose the eggs of the queen with a provision of
	honey.</p>

	<p>I do not wish to insist on creations of this kind
	which are independent of the animal’s will and reflection.
	Near these facts must be placed those in
	which animals, still using a natural secretion, yet
	endeavour to obtain ingenious advantages from it
	unknown by related species.</p>

	<p>There is, for example, the <em lang="la" xml:lang="la">Macropus viridi-auratus</em>,
	or Paradise-fish, which blows air bubbles in the mucus
	produced from its mouth. This mucus becomes fairly
	resistant, and all the bubbles imprisoned and sticking
	aside by side at last form a floor. It
	is beneath this floating shelter that
	the fish suspends its eggs for its
	little ones to undergo their early
	development.</p>

	<p><em id="ch_6_2" class="section_title">Animals who increase their natural
	protection by the addition of
	foreign bodies.</em> — Certain tubicolar
	Annelids, whose skin furnishes
	abundant mucus which does not
	become sufficiently hard to form an efficacious protection,
	utilise it to weld together and unite around
	them neighbouring substances, grains of sand, fragments
	of shell, etc. They thus construct a case
	which both resembles formations by special organs
	and manufacture by the aid of foreign materials.
	The larvæ of <em lang="la" xml:lang="la">Phryganea</em>, who lead an aquatic life, use
	this method to separate themselves from the world
	and prepare tubes in which to dwell. (<a href="#fig18" id="fig18mark">Fig. 18.</a>)
	All the fragments carried down by the stream are
	good for their labours on condition only that they are
	denser than the water. They take possession of
	<a class="pagenum" id="page141" title="141"> </a>fragments of aquatic leaves, and little fragments of
	wood which have been sufficiently long in the water
	to have thoroughly imbibed it and so become heavy
	enough to keep themselves at the bottom, or at least
	to prevent them from floating to the surface. It is
	the larva of <em lang="la" xml:lang="la">Phryganea striata</em> which has been best
	studied; those of neighbouring species evidently act
	much in the same way, with differences only in detail.
	The little carpenter stops a fragment rather longer
	than his own body, lies on it and brings it in contact
	with other pieces along his own sides. He thus
	obtains the skeleton of a cylinder. The largest holes
	are filled up with detritus of all kinds. Then these
	materials are agglutinated by a special secretion.
	The larva overlays the interior of its tube with a
	covering of soft silk which renders the cylinder watertight
	and consolidates the earlier labours. The insect
	is thus in possession of a safe retreat. Resembling
	some piece of rubbish, it completes its metamorphosis
	in peace, undisturbed by the carnivora of the stream.
	There is here already a tendency towards the dwellings
	of which I shall speak later on, and which are entirely
	formed of the external environment.</p>

	<p><em id="ch_6_3" class="section_title">Animals who establish their home in the natural
	or artificial dwellings of others.</em> — Between the beings
	whom nature has endowed with a shelter and those
	who construct it by their own industry, we may
	intercept those who, deprived of a natural asylum and
	not having the inclination or the power to make one,
	utilise the dwellings of others, either when the latter
	still inhabit them, or when they are empty on account
	of the death or departure of the owner. In the
	natural sciences there is no group of facts around
	which may be traced a clear boundary; each of them
	<a class="pagenum" id="page142" title="142"> </a>is more or less closely related to a group which
	appears at first of an entirely different nature. Thus
	it does not enter into our plan to speak of parasites.
	Yet, if among these some turn to a host to demand
	of him both food and shelter, if even they can come
	to be so modified and so marked by parasitism that
	they can live in no other way, there are others who
	ask for lodging only from an animal better protected
	than they are themselves. It is these whose customs
	we are called upon to consider. In the interior of the
	branchial chamber of many bivalvular Mollusca, and
	especially the Mussel, there lives a little crustaceous
	commensal called the Pea-crab (<em lang="la" xml:lang="la">Pinnoteres pisum</em>).
	He goes, comes, hunts, and retires at the least alarm
	within his host’s shell. The mussel, as the price of its
	hospitality, no doubt profits by the prizes which fall
	to the little crab’s claws. It is even said that the crab
	in recognition of the benefits bestowed by his indolent
	friend keeps him acquainted with what is passing
	on around, and as he is much more active and alert
	than his companion he sees danger much farther
	away, and gives notice of it, asking for the door to be
	shut by lightly pinching the mussel’s gill. But this
	gratitude of the Crustacean towards a sympathetic
	bivalve is merely a hypothesis; we do not exactly
	know what passes in the intimacy of these two
	widely-differing natures.</p>

	<p>For birds like the Cuckoo and the <em lang="la" xml:lang="la">Molothrus</em> it is
	not possible to plead attenuating circumstances.
	They occupy a place in an inhabited house without
	paying any sort of rent. Every one knows the
	Cuckoo’s audacity. The female lays her eggs in
	different nests and troubles herself no further about
	their fate. She seeks for her offspring a shelter which
	<a class="pagenum" id="page143" title="143"> </a>she does not take the trouble to construct, and moreover
	at the same time assures for them the cares of a
	stranger in place of her own.</p>

	<p>In North America a kind of Starling, the <em lang="la" xml:lang="la">Molothrus
	pecoris</em>, commonly called the Cow-bird, acts in the
	same careless fashion. It lives in the midst of herds,
	and owes its specific name to this custom; it feeds on
	the parasites on the skin of cattle. This bird constructs
	no nest. At the moment of laying the female
	seeks out an inhabited dwelling, and when the owner
	is absent she furtively lays an egg there. The young
	intruder breaks his shell after four days’ incubation,
	that is to say, usually much before the legitimate
	children; and the parents, in order to silence the beak
	of the stranger who, without shame, claims his share
	with loud cries, neglect their own brood which have
	not yet appeared, and which they abandon. Their
	foster children repay them, however, with the blackest
	ingratitude. As soon as the little <em lang="la" xml:lang="la">Molothrus</em> feels his
	body covered with feathers and his little wings strong
	enough to sustain him he quits his adopted parents
	without consideration. These birds show a love of
	independence very rare among animals, with whom
	conjugal fidelity has become proverbial; they do not
	unite in couples; unions are free, and the mother
	hastens to deliver herself from the cares of bringing
	up her young in the manner we have seen. Two
	other species of <em lang="la" xml:lang="la">Molothrus</em> have the same habit, as have
	the American Cuckoo and the Golden Cuckoo of
	South Africa.</p>

	<p>The habits of the <em lang="la" xml:lang="la">Molothrus bovariensis</em>, a closely
	allied Argentine Cow-bird, have been carefully studied
	by Mr. W. H. Hudson, who has also some interesting
	remarks as to the vestiges of the nesting instinct in
	<a class="pagenum" id="page144" title="144"> </a>this interesting parasitical bird, which now is constantly
	dropping eggs in all sorts of places, even
	on the ground, most of them being lost. “Before and
	during the breeding-season the females, sometimes
	accompanied by the males, are seen continually
	haunting and examining the domed nests of the
	<em lang="la" xml:lang="la">Dendrocolaptidæ</em>. This does not seem like a mere
	freak of curiosity, but their persistence in their
	investigations is precisely like that of birds that
	habitually make choice of such breeding-places. It
	is surprising that they never do actually lay in such
	nests, except when the side or dome has been accidentally
	broken enough to admit the light into the
	interior. Whenever I set boxes up in my trees, the
	female Cow-birds were the first to visit them. Sometimes
	one will spend half a day loitering about and
	inspecting a box, repeatedly climbing round and over
	it, and always ending at the entrance, into which she
	peers curiously, and when about to enter starting
	back, as if scared at the obscurity within. But after
	retiring a little space she will return again and again,
	as if fascinated by the comfort and security of such
	an abode. It is amusing to see how pertinaciously
	they hang about the ovens of the Oven-birds, apparently
	determined to take possession of them,
	flying back after a hundred repulses, and yet not
	entering them even when they have the opportunity.
	Sometimes one is seen following a Wren or a Swallow
	to its nest beneath the eaves, and then clinging to
	the wall beneath the hole into which it disappeared.
	That it is a recurrence to a long-disused habit I can
	scarcely doubt. I may mention that twice I have
	seen birds of this species attempting to build nests,
	and that on both occasions they failed to complete
	<a class="pagenum" id="page145" title="145"> </a>the work. So universal is the nest-making instinct
	that one might safely say the <em lang="la" xml:lang="la">M. bovariensis</em> had once
	possessed it, and that in the cases I have mentioned
	it was a recurrence, too weak to be efficient, to the
	ancestral habit.” Mr. Hudson suggests that this bird
	lost the nest-making instinct by acquiring the semi-parasitical
	habit, common to many South American
	birds, of breeding in the large covered nests of the
	<em lang="la" xml:lang="la">Dendrocolaptidæ</em>, although, owing to increased severity
	in the struggle for the possession of such nests, this
	habit was defeated.<a href="#footnote_81" id="fnm81"  class="fnmarker">81</a></p>

	<p>The <em lang="la" xml:lang="la">Rhodius anarus</em>, a fish of European rivers, also
	ensures a quiet retreat for his offspring by a method
	which is not less indiscreet. At the period of spawning,
	a male chooses a female companion and with
	great vigilance keeps off all those who wish to
	approach her. When the laying becomes imminent,
	the <em lang="la" xml:lang="la">Rhodius</em>, swimming up and down at the bottom
	of the stream, at length discovers a <em lang="la" xml:lang="la">Unio</em>. The
	bivalve is asleep with his shell ajar, not suspecting
	the plot which is being formed against him. It is a
	question of nothing less than of transforming him
	into furnished lodgings. The female fish bears underneath
	her tail a prolongation of the oviduct; she
	introduces it delicately between the Mollusc’s valves
	and allows an egg to fall between his branchial folds.
	In his turn the male approaches, shakes himself over
	it, and fertilises it. Then the couple depart in search
	of another <em lang="la" xml:lang="la">Unio</em>, to whom to confide another representative
	of the race. The egg, well sheltered against
	<a class="pagenum" id="page146" title="146"> </a>dangers from without, undergoes development, and
	one fine day the little fish emerges and frisks away
	from his peaceful retreat.</p>

	<p>Other animals, more respectful of property, avoid
	using another’s dwelling until it is abandoned by its
	proprietor, and no reproach of indelicacy can be
	addressed to the <em lang="la" xml:lang="la">Gobius minutus</em>, a fish which lives
	on our coasts at the mouth of rivers. The female lays
	beneath overturned shells, remains of Oysters, or
	Cardium shells. The valve is buried beneath several
	centimetres of sand, which supports it like a vault. It
	forms a solid roof, beneath which the eggs undergo
	their evolution. Sometimes the male remains by the
	little chamber to watch over their fate. It is possible
	to distinguish the two holes of entrance and exit
	which mark his habitual passage.</p>

	<p>The Hermit-crab perhaps knows best how to take
	advantage of old clothes. (<a href="#fig19" id="fig19mark">Fig. 19.</a>) He collects
	shells of Gasteropods, abandoned flotsam, the first
	inhabitant of which has died. The Hermit-crab
	(<em lang="la" xml:lang="la">Pagurus Bernhardus</em>) is a Decapod Crustacean — that
	is to say, he resembles a very small Crab.
	But his inveterate habit during so many generations
	of sheltering his abdomen in a shell prevents this
	part from being encrusted with lime and becoming
	hard. The legs and the head remain in the
	ordinary condition outside the house, and the
	animal moves bearing it everywhere with him; on
	the least warning he retires into it entirely. But
	the Crustacean grows. When young he had chosen
	a small shell. A Mollusc, in growing, makes his
	house grow with him. The Hermit-crab cannot do
	this, and when his dwelling has become too narrow
	he abandons it for one that is more comfortable.</p>

	<p class="continued_paragraph"><a class="pagenum" id="page148" title="148"> </a>At first enclosed in the remains of a <em lang="la" xml:lang="la">Trochus</em>, he

	shells assure to the Crustacean, they serve to mask
	his ferocity, and the prey which approaches confidently
	what it takes to be an inoffensive Mollusc,
	becomes his victim.</p>

	<p>The Great Horned Owl likewise does not construct
	a nest; but takes possession of the dwellings
	abandoned by others. These birds utilise for laying
	their eggs sometimes the nest of a Crow or a Dove,
	sometimes the lair which a Squirrel had considered
	too dilapidated. The female, without troubling
	about the bad state of these ruins, or taking pains
	to repair them, lays her eggs here and sits on
	them.</p>

	<p><em id="ch_6_4" class="section_title">Classification of artificial shelters.</em> — It is time to
	turn to animals who have more regard for comfort,
	and who erect dwellings for themselves or their
	offspring. These dwellings may be divided into three
	groups: (1) Those which are hollowed in earth or in
	wood; (2) those which in the simplest form result
	from the division of material of any kind; then, as a
	complication, of materials bound together; then, as
	a last refinement, of delicate materials, such as blades
	of grass or threads of wool woven together; such are
	the nests of certain birds and the tents of nomads;
	(3) those which are built of moist earth which
	becomes hard on drying; the perfection of this
	method consists of piling up hard fragments, pieces
	of wood or ashlar, the moist earth being only a
	mortar which unites the hard parts together. Animals
	exercise with varying success these different methods,
	all of which Man still practises.</p>

	<p><a class="pagenum" id="page149" title="149"> </a><em id="ch_6_5" class="section_title">Hollowed dwellings — Rudimentary burrows.</em> — We
	will first occupy ourselves with the dwelling hollowed
	in the earth. It is the least complicated form. The
	number of creatures who purely and simply bury
	themselves thus to obtain shelter is incalculable; I
	will only mention a few examples, and pass on from
	simple combinations to the more perfected industries,
	of which they present the first sketch.</p>

	<p>It is known that at a certain epoch of the year
	Crabs abandon their hard carapaces. This phenomenon
	is known by the name of the moult; they
	remain in this condition for some time; it is the
	period during which they grow; then their integuments
	are encrusted anew with lime and again become
	resistant. While they are thus deprived of their
	ordinary protection they are exposed to a crowd of
	dangers, and they are so well aware of this that they
	remain hidden beneath rocks and pebbles. A crab
	of Guadeloupe, called <em lang="la" xml:lang="la">Gecarinus ruricola</em>, escapes the
	perils of this situation, thanks to its kind of life and
	its habit of hollowing out a burrow to live in while it
	is deprived of its habitual defence. This Crustacean
	lives on the earth, at a distance of about ten or twelve
	kilometres from the sea-shore, and nourishes itself on
	animal and vegetable remains. It approaches the
	water only at the period of laying eggs, turning
	towards the coast in the months of February and
	March. This migration does not take place, like some
	others, in compact bands; each follows the road in
	independence, and preserves a certain amount of
	liberty with regard to the path and the epoch of the
	journey. They lead an aquatic life till May or June;
	then the female abandons her little ones, who had
	begun their development attached to her claws, and
	<a class="pagenum" id="page150" title="150"> </a>they return to land. The moult takes place in
	August. At the approach of this dreaded crisis each
	hollows a hole between two roots, supplies it with
	green leaves, and carefully stops up the entrance.
	These labours accomplished, the crab is entirely
	sheltered; it undergoes the moult in safety, and does
	not emerge from its retreat until it is again capable of
	facing enemies, and of seizing food with its claws,
	which have become hard again. This seclusion
	appears to last a month. Here is, then, an example of
	a temporary dwelling rendered necessary by special
	conditions of defect for external life. We are here
	still in the infancy of the art.</p>

	<p>Speaking generally, birds are accomplished architects.
	Certain of them are, however, content with a
	rudimentary cavern. There is no question here of
	those who retire to clefts in the rock or in trunks of
	trees, for in these cases the cavity is only the support
	of the true house, and it is in the construction of this
	that the artist reveals his talent. I wish to speak of
	animals which remain in a burrow without making a
	nest there. A Parroquet of New Zealand called the
	<em lang="la" xml:lang="la">Kakapo</em> (<em lang="la" xml:lang="la">Strigops habroptilus</em>) thus dwells in natural
	or hollowed excavations. It is only found in a
	restricted portion of the island and leads a miserable
	life there, habitually staying in the earth and pursued
	by numerous enemies, especially half-wild dogs. It
	tries to hold its own, but its wings and beak do not
	suffice to protect it, and the race would have completely
	disappeared if these birds were not able to
	resist, owing to the prudence with which they stay
	within their dwellings. They profit by a natural
	retreat, or one constructed in rocks or beneath roots
	of trees; they only come out when impelled by
	<a class="pagenum" id="page151" title="151"> </a>hunger, and return as soon as they can in case of
	danger.</p>

	<p>A large number of animals also hollow out shelters
	for their eggs, with the double object of maintaining
	them at a constant temperature and of concealing
	them. Most reptiles act in this manner. The way
	in which a Tortoise, the <em lang="la" xml:lang="la">Cistudo lunaria</em>, prepares its
	nest is extremely curious. When the time for this
	labour arrives, the tortoise chooses a site. It commences
	by boring in the earth with the end of its tail,
	the muscles of which are held firmly contracted; it
	turns the tail like a gimlet and succeeds in making a
	conical hole. Gradually the depth of the hole becomes
	equal to the length of the tail, and the tool then
	becomes useless. The <em lang="la" xml:lang="la">Cistudo</em> enlarges the cavity
	with the help of its posterior legs. Using them
	alternately it withdraws the earth and kicks it away,
	then piles up this rubbish on the edge of the hole,
	arranging it so as to form a circular rampart. Soon
	the posterior members can take nothing more from
	the too distant bottom. The moment for laying has
	now come. As soon as the egg arrives at the cloaca
	one of the feet seizes it and lowers it gently into
	the nest, while the second foot seizes another egg,
	which during this time had appeared at the orifice.
	This manipulation lasts until the end of the operation,
	when the tortoise buries all its family, and
	to flatten the prominence which results she strikes
	it repeatedly with her plastron, raising herself on
	her legs.</p>

	<p>It is not only land animals which adopt this custom
	of living in the earth, and there sheltering their offspring.
	Fish also make retreats on the bank or at
	the bottom. To mention only one case, the Bullhead
	<a class="pagenum" id="page152" title="152"> </a>(<em lang="la" xml:lang="la">Cottus gobio</em>) of our rivers, which spawns in the Seine
	in May, June, and July, acts in this manner. Beneath
	a rock in the sand it prepares a cavity; then seeks
	females and brings them to lay eggs in its little
	lodging. During the four or five weeks before they
	come out it watches the eggs, keeping away as far as
	possible every danger which threatens them. It only
	leaves its position when pressed by hunger, and as
	soon as the hunt is concluded, returns to the post of
	duty.</p>

	<p>Other animals when digging have a double object;
	they wish to shelter themselves, and at the same time
	to find the water which they need for themselves or
	for the development of their young.</p>

	<p>It is well known that Frogs and Toads generally go
	in the spring to lay their eggs in streams and ponds.
	A Batrachian of Brazil and the hot regions of South
	America, the <em lang="la" xml:lang="la">Cystignathus ocellatus</em>, no doubt fearing
	too many dangers for the spawn if deposited in the
	open water, employs the artifice of hollowing, not far
	from the bank, a hole the bottom of which is filled by
	infiltration. It there places its eggs, and the little
	ones on their birth can lead an aquatic life while
	being guaranteed against its risks.</p>

	<p>A terrestrial Crab, the <em lang="la" xml:lang="la">Cardisoma carnifex</em>, found
	in Bengal and the Antilles, acts in the same manner;
	but in this case it has in view its own convenience
	and not care for its offspring. Its habitat is especially
	in low-lying spots near the shore, where water may
	be found at a trifling depth beneath the soil. To
	establish its dwelling, the Crustacean first buries itself
	until it reaches the liquid level. Arrived at this point,
	it makes a large lair in the soft soil, and effects communication
	with the outside by various openings. It
	<a class="pagenum" id="page153" title="153"> </a>can thus easily come and go and retire into its cave,
	where it finds security and a humidity favourable for
	branchial respiration. From time to time it cleans
	out the dirt and rubbish which accumulate in the
	hole. It makes a little pile of all the refuse which it
	finds, and, seizing it between its claws and abdomen,
	carries it outside. Executing several journeys very
	rapidly, it soon clears out its dwelling.</p>

	<p>The dipnoid <em lang="la" xml:lang="la">Protopterus</em>, which inhabits the
	marshes of Senegal and Gambia, is curious in more
	than one respect. Firstly, it can breathe oxygen,
	whether, like other fish, it finds it dissolved in water
	or in the atmospheric air. When during the summer
	the marshes in which it lives dry up, it takes refuge
	in the mud at the bottom, which hardens and imprisons
	it, and it thus remains curled up until the
	time when the water after the rainy season has
	softened the earth which surrounds it. This fact had
	been known for some time; travellers had brought
	back lumps of dried earth of varied size, the largest
	about as big as two fists. On opening them the
	same fish was always found within, and the chamber
	in which it is contained was lined with a sort of
	cocoon, having the appearance of dry gelatine.
	Duméril was able to observe one of these animals
	in captivity. At the period corresponding to the
	dry period of its own country, the <em lang="la" xml:lang="la">Protopterus</em> buried
	itself in the mud which had been placed at the bottom
	of the aquarium. In order to realise the conditions
	found in nature, the water which covered it was
	gradually withdrawn. The earth hardened in drying,
	and when broken the recluse was seen surrounded by
	hardened mucus, exactly like those which came from
	Senegal.</p>

	<p><a class="pagenum" id="page154" title="154"> </a><em id="ch_6_6" class="section_title">Carefully-disposed burrows.</em> — All the cases which we
	have considered show us the industry of the hollowed
	dwelling in its primitive state; but other animals
	know how to furnish it with greater luxury. I will
	continue in the same order of increasing complication.
	Many beings live permanently in a burrow;
	Reptiles — Snakes or Lizards — are to be placed among
	these. Among others, the <em lang="la" xml:lang="la">Lacerta stirpium</em> arranges
	a narrow and deep hole, well hidden beneath a thicket,
	and retires into it for the winter, when cold renders
	it incapable of movement and at the mercy of its
	enemies. Before giving itself up to its hybernal sleep,
	it is careful to close hermetically the opening of the
	dwelling with a little earth and dried leaves. When
	spring returns and the heat awakens the reptile, it comes
	out to warm itself and to hunt, but never abandons
	its dwelling, always retiring into it in case of alarm
	and to pass there cold days and nights.</p>

	<p>Darwin has observed and described<a href="#footnote_82" id="fnm82"  class="fnmarker">82</a> how a little
	Lacertilian, the <em lang="la" xml:lang="la">Conolophus subcristatus</em>, conducts its
	work of mining and digging. It establishes its burrow
	in a soft tufa, and directs it almost horizontally,
	hollowing it out in such a way that the axis of the
	hole makes a very small angle with the soil. This
	reptile does not foolishly expend its strength in this
	troublesome labour. It only works with one side of
	its body at a time, allowing the other side to rest.
	For instance, the right anterior leg sets to work
	digging, while the posterior leg on the same side
	throws out the earth. When fatigued, the left legs
	come into play, allowing the others to repose.</p>

	<p>Other animals, without building their cavern with
	remarkable skill, show much sagacity in the choice of
	<a class="pagenum" id="page155" title="155"> </a>a site calculated to obtain certain determined advantages.
	In Egypt there are dogs which have become
	wild. Having shaken off the yoke of man, which
	in the East affords them little or no support, they
	lead an independent life. During the day they
	remain quiescent in desert spots or ruins, and at night
	they prowl about like jackals, hunting living prey or
	feeding on abandoned carcasses. There are hills
	which have in a manner become the property of
	these animals. They have founded villages there,
	and allow no one to approach. These hills have an
	orientation from north to south, so that one slope is
	exposed to the sun from morning to mid-day and the
	other from mid-day to evening. Now, dogs have a
	great horror of heat. They fear the torrid heat of
	the south as much as in our climate they like to lie
	warmed by gentle rays; there is no shadow too deep
	for their siesta. Therefore, on these Egyptian hills
	every dog hollows out a lair on both slopes. One of
	these dwellings is thus turned towards the east, the
	other towards the west. In the morning, when he
	returns from his nocturnal expeditions, the animal
	takes refuge in the second, and remains there until
	mid-day, sunk in refreshing sleep. At that hour the
	sun begins to reach him, and to escape it he passes
	over to the opposite slope; it is a curious sight to see
	them all, with pendent heads and sleepy air, advance
	with trailing steps to their eastern retreat, settle down
	in it, and continue their dream and their digestion
	till evening, when they again set forth to prowl. We
	never grow tired of admiring the intelligence of their
	domesticated fellows, but this trait seems to me worthy
	of remark; it proves a very developed power of observation
	and reflection.</p>

	that there were four chief types of burrow, shown in
	the accompanying illustration (<a href="#fig20" id="fig20mark">Fig. 20</a>) at about one-third
	<a class="pagenum" id="page157" title="157"> </a>the actual size (except C1 and D1, which are of
	natural size). While A and B have only one door, C
	and D, besides the surface door, have another a short
	way under ground. The whole burrow as well as the
	door are lined with silk, which also forms the hinge.
	The great art of the Trap-door Spider lies in her
	skilful forming of the door, which fits tightly, although
	it opens widely when she emerges, and which she
	frequently holds down
	when an intruder
	strives to enter, and in
	the manner with which
	the presence of the
	door is concealed, so
	as to harmonise with

	Perhaps in no case is
	the concealment more

	or roots, as in the accompanying illustration, which

	<p>The Trap-door Spider (<em lang="la" xml:lang="la">Mygale henzii</em>, Girard),
	which is widely diffused in California, forms a simple
	shaft-like burrow, but, like the European Trap-door
	Spider, it is very skilful in forming an entrance and
	<a class="pagenum" id="page158" title="158"> </a>in concealing its presence. Its habits have lately
	been described by D. Cleveland of San Diego.<a href="#footnote_84" id="fnm84"  class="fnmarker">84</a> In
	the adobe land hillocks are numerous; they are about
	a foot in height, and some three or four feet in
	diameter. These hillocks are selected by the spiders — apparently
	because they afford excellent drainage,
	and cannot be washed away by the winter rains — and
	their stony summits are often full of spiders’ nests.
	These subterranean dwellings are shafts sunk vertically
	in the earth, except where some stony obstruction
	compels the miner to deflect from a downward
	course. The shafts are from five to twelve inches in
	depth, and from one-half to one and a half inches in
	diameter, depending largely upon the age and size of
	the spider.</p>

	<p>When the spider has decided upon a location,
	which is always in clay, adobe or stiff soil, he
	excavates the shaft by means of the sharp horns at
	the end of his mandibles, which are his pick and
	shovel and mining tools. The earth is held between
	the mandibles and carried to the surface. When the
	shaft is of the required size, the spider smoothes and
	glazes the wall with a fluid which is secreted by
	itself. Then the whole shaft is covered with
	a silken paper lining, spun from the animal’s
	spinnerets.</p>

	<p>The door at the top of the shaft is made of several
	alternate layers of silk and earth, and is supplied
	with an elastic and ingenious hinge, and fits closely
	in a groove around the rim of the tube. This door
	simulates the surface on which it lies, and is distinguishable
	from it only by a careful scrutiny. The
	clever spider even glues earth and bits of small plants
	<a class="pagenum" id="page159" title="159"> </a>on the upper side of his trap-door, thus making it
	closely resemble the surrounding surface.</p>

	<p>The spider generally stations itself at the bottom
	of the tube. When, by tapping on the door, or by
	other means, a gentle vibration is caused, the spider
	runs to the top of his nest, raises the lid, looks
	out and reconnoitres. If a small creature is seen, it
	is seized and devoured. If the invader is more
	formidable, the door is quickly closed, seized and
	held down by the spider, so that much force is
	required to lever it open. Then, with the intruder
	looking down upon him, the spider drops to the
	bottom of his shaft.</p>

	<p>It has been found by many experiments that when
	the door of his nest is removed, the spider can renew
	it five times — never more than that. Within these
	limitations, the door torn off in the evening was found
	replaced by a new one in the morning. Each successive
	renewal showed, however, a greater proportion
	of earth, and a smaller proportion of silk, until finally
	the fifth door had barely enough silk to hold the
	earth together. The sixth attempt, if made, was a
	failure, because the spinnerets had exhausted their
	supply of the web fluid. When the poor persecuted
	spider finds his domicile thus open and defenceless,
	he is compelled to leave it, and wait until his stock of
	web fluid is renewed.<a href="#footnote_85" id="fnm85"  class="fnmarker">85</a></p>

	<p>Skilful diggers prepare burrows with several entrances;
	some even arrange several rooms, each for a
	special object. The Otter seeks its food in the water,
	<a class="pagenum" id="page160" title="160"> </a>and actively hunts fish in ponds and rivers. But
	when fishing is over, it likes to keep dry and at the
	same time sheltered from terrestrial enemies. Its
	dwelling must also present an easy opening into the
	water. In order to fulfil all these conditions, its house
	consists first of a large room hollowed in the bank at
	a level sufficiently high to be beyond reach of floods.
	From the bottom of this keep a passage starts which
	sinks and opens about fifty centimetres beneath the
	surface of the water. It is through here that the
	Otter noiselessly glides to find himself in the midst
	of his hunting domain without having been seen or
	been obliged to make a noisy plunge which would
	put the game to flight. If this were all, the hermetically-closed
	dwelling would soon become uninhabitable,
	as there would be no provision for renewing the air,
	so the Otter proceeds to form a second passage from
	the ceiling of the room to the ground, thus forming a
	ventilation tube. In order that this may not prove a
	cause of danger, it is always made to open up in the
	midst of brushwood or in a tuft of rushes and reeds.</p>

	<p>Marmots also are not afraid of the work which will
	assure them a warm and safe refuge in the regions
	they inhabit, where the climate is rough. In summer
	they ascend the Alps to a height of 2,500 to 3,000
	metres and rapidly hollow a burrow like that for
	winter time, which I am about to describe, but smaller
	and less comfortable. They retire into it during bad
	weather or to pass the night. When the snow
	chases them away and causes them to descend to a
	lower zone, they think about constructing a genuine
	house in which to shut themselves during the winter
	and to sleep. Twelve or fifteen of these little animals
	unite their efforts to make first a horizontal passage,
	<a class="pagenum" id="page161" title="161"> </a>which may reach the length of three or four metres.
	They enlarge the extremity of it into a vaulted and
	circular room more than two metres in diameter.
	They make there a good pile of very dry hay on
	which they all install themselves, after having carefully
	protected themselves against the external cold
	by closing up the passage with stones and calking the
	interstices with grass and moss.</p>

	<p>In solitary woods or roads the Badger (<em lang="la" xml:lang="la">Meles</em>), who
	does not like noise, prepares for himself a peaceful
	retreat, clean and well ventilated, composed of a vast
	chamber situated about a metre and a half beneath
	the surface. He spares no pains over it, and makes
	it communicate with the external world by seven or
	eight very long passages, so that the points where
	they open are about thirty paces distant from one
	another. In this way, if an enemy discovers one of
	them and introduces himself into the Badger’s home,
	the Badger can still take flight through one of the
	other passages. In ordinary times they serve for the
	aëration of the central room. The animal attaches
	considerable importance to this. He is also very
	clean in his habits, and every day may be seen coming
	out for little walks, having an object of an opposite
	nature to the search for food. This praiseworthy
	habit is, as we shall see, exploited by the Fox in an
	unworthy manner.</p>

	<p>The Fox has many misdeeds on his conscience, but
	his conduct towards the Badger is peculiarly indelicate.
	The Fox is a skilful digger, and when he
	cannot avoid it, he can hollow out a house with
	several rooms. The dwelling has numerous openings,
	both as a measure of prudence and of hygiene, for
	this arrangement enables the air to be renewed. He
	<a class="pagenum" id="page162" title="162"> </a>prepares several chambers side by side; one of which
	he uses for observation and to take his siesta in; a
	second as a sort of larder in which he piles up what
	he cannot devour at once; a third, in which the
	female brings forth and rears her young. But he
	does not hesitate to avoid this labour when possible.
	If he finds a rabbit warren he tries first to eat the
	inhabitants, and then, his mind cleared from this
	anxiety, arranges their domicile to his own taste, and
	comfortably installs himself in it. In South America,
	again, the Argentine Fox frequently takes up permanent
	residence in a vizcachera, ejecting the rightful
	owners; he is so quiet and unassuming in his manners
	that the vizcachas become indifferent to his presence,
	but in spring the female fox will seize on the young
	vizcachas to feed her own young, and if she has eight
	or nine, the young of the whole village of vizcachas
	may be exterminated.</p>

	<p>The Badger’s dwelling appears to the Fox particularly
	enviable. In order to dislodge the proprietor he
	adopts the following plan. Knowing that the latter
	can tolerate no ordure near his home, he chooses as a
	place of retirement one of the passages which lead
	to the chamber of the peaceful recluse. He insists
	repeatedly, until at last the Badger, insulted by this
	grossness, and suffocated by the odour, decides to
	move elsewhere and hollow a fresh palace. The Fox
	is only waiting for this, and installs himself without
	ceremony.</p>

	<p>The Vizcacha (<em lang="la" xml:lang="la">Lagostomus trichodactylus</em>) is a large
	Rodent inhabiting a vast extent of country in the
	pampas of La Plata, Patagonia, etc. Unlike most
	other burrowing species, the Vizcacha prefers to work
	on open level spots. On the great grassy plains it is
	<a class="pagenum" id="page163" title="163"> </a>even able to make its own conditions, like the Beaver,
	and is in this respect, and in its highly-developed social
	instinct, among the two or three Mammals which
	approach Man, although only a Rodent, and even in
	this order, according to Waterhouse, coming very low
	down by reason of its marsupial affinities.</p>

	<p>The Vizcacha lives in small communities of from
	twenty to thirty members, in a village of deep-chambered
	burrows, some twelve or fifteen in number, with
	large pit-like entrances closely grouped together, and
	as the Vizcachera, as this village is called, endures for
	an indefinitely long period, the earth which is constantly
	brought up forms an irregular mound thirty
	or forty feet in diameter, and from fifteen to thirty
	inches above the level of the road; this mound serves
	to protect the dwelling from floods on low ground.
	A clearing is made all round the abode and all
	rubbish thrown on the mound; the Vizcachas thus
	have a smooth turf on which to disport themselves,
	and are freed from the danger of lurking enemies.</p>

	<p>The entire village occupies an area of one hundred
	to two hundred square feet of ground. The burrows
	vary greatly in extent; usually in a Vizcachera there
	are several that, at a distance of from four to six feet
	from the entrance, open into large circular chambers.
	From these chambers other burrows diverge in all
	directions, some running horizontally, others obliquely
	downwards to a maximum depth of six feet from the
	surface; some of these galleries communicate with
	those of other burrows.</p>

	<p>On viewing a Vizcachera closely, the first thing that
	strikes the observer is the enormous size of the
	entrances to the central burrows in the mound; there
	are usually several smaller outside burrows. The
	<a class="pagenum" id="page164" title="164"> </a>entrance to some of the principal burrows is sometimes
	four to six feet across the mouth, and sometimes
	it is deep enough for a tall man to stand in up to
	the waist.</p>

	<p>It is not easy to tell what induces a Vizcacha to
	found a new community, for they increase very slowly,
	and are very fond of each other’s society. It is
	invariably one individual alone who founds the new
	village. If it were for the sake of better pasture he
	would remove to a considerable distance, but he
	merely goes from forty to sixty yards off to begin
	operations. Sooner or later, perhaps after many
	months, other individuals join the solitary Vizcacha,
	and they become the parents of innumerable generations
	in the same village: old men, who have lived
	all their lives in one district, remember that many
	of the Vizcacheras around them existed when they
	were children.</p>

	<p>It is always a male who begins the new village.
	Although he does not always adopt the same method,
	he usually works very straight into the earth, digging
	a hole twelve or fourteen inches wide, but not so
	deep, at an angle of about 25° with the surface. After
	he has progressed inwards for a few feet, the animal is
	no longer content merely to scatter the loose earth;
	he cleans it away in a straight line from the entrance,
	and scratches so much on this line, apparently to make
	the slope gentler, that he soon forms a trench a foot
	or more in depth, and often three or four feet in
	length. This facilitates the conveyance of the loose
	earth as far as possible from the entrance of the
	burrow. But after a while the animal is unwilling
	that earth should accumulate even at the end of this
	long passage, and proceeds to form two additional
	<a class="pagenum" id="page165" title="165"> </a>trenches, making an acute or right angle converging
	into the first trench, so that the whole when completed
	takes a <em class="notation">Y</em> shape. These trenches are continually
	deepened and lengthened in this manner,
	the angular segment of earth between them being
	scratched away, until by degrees it gives place to one
	large deep irregular mouth. The burrows are made
	best in the black and red moulds of the pampas; but
	even in such soils the entrances may be varied. In
	some the central trench is wanting, or so short that
	there appear to be but two passages converging
	directly into the burrow, or these two trenches may
	be so curved inwards as to form the segment of
	a circle. Usually, however, the varieties are only
	modifications of the <em class="notation">Y</em>-shaped system.</p>

	<p>On the pampas a wide-mouthed burrow possesses
	a distinct advantage over the more usual shape. The
	two outer trenches diverge so widely from the mouth
	that half the earth brought out is cast behind instead
	of before it, thus creating a mound of equal height
	about the entrance, by which it is secured from water
	during great rainfalls, while cattle avoid treading over
	the great pit-like entrances, though they soon tread and
	break in the burrows of the Armadillo and other
	species when these make their homes on perfectly
	level ground.</p>

	<p>The Vizcachas do not usually leave their burrows
	until dark, but in summer they come out before sunset.
	Usually one of the old males first appears,
	and sits on some prominent place on the mound,
	apparently in no haste to begin his evening meal.
	Other Vizcachas soon begin to appear, each quietly
	taking up his position at the burrow’s mouth. The
	females, known by their smaller size and lighter
	<a class="pagenum" id="page166" title="166"> </a>colour, sit upright on their haunches, as if to command
	a better view; they are always wilder and sprightlier
	in their gestures than the males. They view a human
	stranger with a mixture of fear and curiosity, sometimes
	allowing him to come within five or six paces
	of them; in desert regions, however, where enemies
	are numerous, the Vizcacha is very timid and
	wary.</p>

	<p>These animals are very sociable, and their sociability
	extends beyond their own vizcachera. On approaching
	a vizcachera at night, usually some of the Vizcachas
	on it scamper off to distant burrows. These are neighbours
	merely come to pay a friendly visit. The
	intercourse is so frequent that little straight paths are
	formed from one village to another. Their social
	instinct leads members of one village to assist those
	of another when in trouble. Thus, if a vizcachera is
	covered over with earth in order to destroy the
	animals within, Vizcachas from distant burrows will
	subsequently be found zealously digging out their
	friends. The hospitality of the Vizcacha does not,
	however, extend to his burrow; he has a very strong
	feeling with regard to the sanctity of the burrow.
	A Vizcacha never enters another’s burrow, and if by
	chance driven into one by dogs will emerge speedily,
	apparently finding that the danger within is greater than
	the danger without. In connection with the sociability
	of the Vizcacha, we must take into consideration the
	fact that Vizcachas possess a wonderfully varied and
	expressive language, and are engaged in perpetual
	discussion all night long.<a href="#footnote_86" id="fnm86"  class="fnmarker">86</a></p>

	<p><a class="pagenum" id="page167" title="167"> </a><em id="ch_6_7" class="section_title">Burrows with barns adjoined.</em> — Certain Rodents
	have carried hollow dwellings to great perfection.
	Among these the Hamster of Germany (<em lang="la" xml:lang="la">Cricetus
	frumentarius</em>) is not the least ingenious. To his
	dwelling-room he adds three or four storehouses for
	the amassed provisions of which I have already had
	occasion to speak. The burrow possesses two openings:
	one, which the animal prefers to use, which
	sinks vertically into the soil; the other, the passage
	of exit with a gentle and very winding slope. The
	bottom of the central room is carpeted with moss and
	straw, which make it a warm and pleasant home.
	A third tunnel starts from this sleeping chamber,
	soon forking and leading to the wheat barns. Thus
	during the winter the Hamster has no pressing need
	to go out except on fine days for a little fresh air.
	He has everything within his reach, and can remain
	shut up with nothing to fear from the severity of the
	season.</p>

	<p><em id="ch_6_8" class="section_title">Dwellings hollowed out in wood.</em> — It is not only the
	soil which may serve for retreat; wood serves as an
	asylum for numerous animals, who bore it, and find
	in it both food and shelter. In this class must be
	placed a large number of Worms, Insects, and Crustaceans.
	One of these last, the <em lang="la" xml:lang="la">Chelura terebrans</em>, a
	little Amphipod, constitutes a great danger for the
	works of man. It attacks piles sunken to support
	structures, and undermines them to such a degree that
	they eventually fall. Wood is formed of concentric
	layers alternately composed of large vessels formed
	during the summer, and smaller vessels formed during
	the winter. The latter zones are more resistant, the
	former are softer. When one of these Crustaceans
	attacks a pile, it first bores a little horizontal passage,
	<a class="pagenum" id="page168" title="168"> </a>stopping at a layer of summer-growth. It there
	hollows a large grotto, leaving here and there pillars
	of support. It lays in this space. The new generation
	working around the parents increases the space
	and feeds on the wood removed. A second generation
	is produced, and the inhabitants become pressed
	for space. The new-born pierce numerous passages
	and penetrate towards the interior of the pile as far as
	the next summer layer. There they spread themselves,
	always boring; they construct new rooms like
	the first, and arrange pillars here and there. Their
	descendants gain the subjacent zone, and so the
	process goes on. During this time the early ancestors
	who hollowed the surface dwellings have died, and
	the holes which they made are no longer habitable;
	but they have all contributed to diminish the resistance
	of the wood, and this continues as long as the
	race which they produced makes its way towards the
	centre of the stake.</p>

		<a href="images/fig_22.png"><img src="images/th_fig_22.png" width="213" height="183" alt="A bee, sitting on a piece of wood with a cross-section showing how it's hollowed out." /></a>
		<p class="caption"><a href="#fig22mark">Fig. 22.</a></p>
	</div>

	<p>An insect, the <em lang="la" xml:lang="la">Xylocopa violacea</em> (<a href="#fig22" id="fig22mark">Fig. 22</a>), related
	to our Humble-bee, from which it differs in several
	anatomical characters, and by the dark violet tint of
	its wings, brings an improvement to the formation of
	the shelter which it makes in wood for its larvæ.
	Instead of hollowing a mere retreat to place there all
	its eggs indiscriminately, it divides them into compartments,
	separated by horizontal partitions. It is the
	female alone who accomplishes this task, connected
	with the function of perpetuating the race. She
	chooses an old tree-trunk, a pole, or the post of a
	fence, exposed to the sun and already worm-eaten, so
	that her labour may be lightened. She first attacks
	the wood perpendicularly to the surface, then suddenly
	turns and directs downwards the passage, the
	<a class="pagenum" id="page169" title="169"> </a>
	diameter of which is about equal to the size of the
	insect’s body. The <em lang="la" xml:lang="la">Xylocopa</em> thus forms a tube about
	thirty centimetres in length. Quite at the bottom
	she places the first egg, leaving beside it a provision
	of honey necessary to nourish the larva during its
	evolution; she then closes it with a partition. This
	partition is made with fragments of the powder of
	wood glued together with saliva. A first horizontal
	ring is applied round the circumference of the tube;
	then in the interior of this first ring a second is
	formed, and so on continuously, until the central
	opening, more and more reduced, is at last entirely
	closed up. This ceiling forms the floor for the next
	chamber, in which the female deposits a new egg,
	provided, like the other, with abundant provisions.
	The same acts are repeated until the retreat becomes
	<a class="pagenum" id="page170" title="170"> </a>transformed into a series of isolated cells in which
	the larvæ can effect their development, and from
	which they will emerge either by themselves perforating
	a thin wall which separates them from daylight,
	or by an opening which the careful mother has
	left to allow them to attain liberty without trouble.<a href="#footnote_87" id="fnm87"  class="fnmarker">87</a></p>

	<p><em id="ch_6_9" class="section_title">Woven dwellings.</em> — The second class of habitation,
	which I have called the woven dwelling, proceeds at
	first from the parcelling up of substances, then of
	objects capable of being entangled like wisps of wood
	or straw, then of fine and supple materials which the
	artisan can work together in a regular manner, that is
	to say by felting or weaving. Facts will show us the
	successive stages of improvement which have been
	introduced into this industry. I will begin with the
	more rudimentary.</p>

	<p><em id="ch_6_10" class="section_title">Rudiments of this industry.</em> — There are, first, cases
	in which the will of the animal does not intervene, or
	at least is very slightly manifested. The creature is
	found covered and protected by foreign bodies which
	are often living beings. Spider-crabs (<em lang="la" xml:lang="la">Maïa</em>), for
	example, have their carapaces covered with algæ and
	hydroids of all sorts. Thus garnished, the Crustaceans
	have the advantage of not being recognised
	from afar when they go hunting, since beneath this
	fleece they resemble some rock. H. Fol has observed
	at Villefranche-sur-Mer a <em lang="la" xml:lang="la">Maïa</em> so buried beneath
	this vegetation that it was impossible at first sight to
	distinguish it from the stones around. Under these
	conditions the animal submits to a shelter rather than
	creates it. Yet it is not so passive as one might at
	first be led to suppose. When the algæ which

	delay its progress, it tears them off with its claws
	and thoroughly cleans itself. The carapace being
	quite clean, the animal finds itself too smooth and
	too easy to distinguish from surrounding objects; it
	therefore takes up again fragments of algæ and replaces
	them where they do not delay to take root like
	cuttings and to flourish anew. This culture is therefore
	intentional; the crab directs it and arrests its
	exuberance; it is no more the victim of it than the
	gardener is the slave of the vegetables which he
	waters day by day. From generation to generation
	this crab has acquired the habit, the instinct if one
	prefers, of thus covering itself so that it may be confused
	with neighbouring objects. Naturally it is
	ignorant of botany, and knows nothing of cuttings.
	If placed in an aquarium with little fragments of
	paper it will seize them and place them on its back,
	as it would have done with algæ, without troubling
	as to whether they become fixed or not. In spite of
	this lack of judgment, we cannot fail to recognise
	in this <em lang="la" xml:lang="la">Maïa</em> a certain ingenuity in self-concealment.</p>

	</div>

	<p>The Sponge-crab (<em lang="la" xml:lang="la">Dromia vulgaris</em>) also practises
	this method of shelter. It seizes a large sponge and
	maintains it firmly over its carapace with the help of
	the posterior pair of limbs. The sponge continues to
	prosper and to spread over the Crustacean who has
	adopted it. (<a href="#fig23" id="fig23mark">Fig. 23.</a>) The two beings do not
	seem to be definitely fixed to each other; the contact
	of a sudden wave will separate them. When the
	divorce is effected, the <em lang="la" xml:lang="la">Dromia</em> immediately throws
	itself on its cherished covering and replaces it. M.
	Künckel d’Herculais tells of one of these curious
	<a class="pagenum" id="page172" title="172"> </a>
	crustaceans which delighted the workers in the laboratory
	of Concarneau. The need for covering themselves
	experienced by these Crabs is so strong that
	in aquariums when their sponge is taken away they
	<a class="pagenum" id="page173" title="173"> </a>will apply to the back a fragment of wrack or of
	anything which comes to hand. A little white cloak
	with the arms of Brittany was manufactured for one
	of these captives, and it was very amusing to see him
	put on his overcoat when he had nothing else wherewith
	to cover himself.<a href="#footnote_88" id="fnm88"  class="fnmarker">88</a></p>

	<p>In these two cases which I have brought forward
	to exhibit the rudiments of this industry, the animals’
	reflection and will play but a small part; even in
	the <em lang="la" xml:lang="la">Dromia</em> custom is so inveterate in the race that
	it has reacted on the animal’s organisation, and its
	four posterior legs are profoundly modified for the
	purpose of firmly holding the sheltering sponge; they
	no longer serve for swimming or walking. The
	animals of which I have now to speak possess more
	initiative; although all do not act with the same
	success, or show themselves equally skilful. Let us
	turn first to the least experienced.</p>

	<p>An Australian bird, the <em lang="la" xml:lang="la">Catheturus Lathami</em>, as
	described by Gould, is still in the rudiments, and
	limits itself to preparing an enormous pile of leaves.
	It begins its work some weeks before laying its
	eggs; with its claws it pushes behind it all the dead
	leaves which fall on the earth and brings them into a
	heap. The bird throws new material on the summit
	until the hole is of suitable height. This detritus
	ferments when left to itself, and a gentle heat is
	developed in the centre of the edifice. The <em lang="la" xml:lang="la">Catheturus</em>
	returns to lay near this coarse shelter; it then
	takes each egg and buries it in the heap, the larger
	end uppermost. It places a new layer above, and
	quits its labour for good. Incubation takes place
	favoured by the uniform heat of this decomposing
	<a class="pagenum" id="page174" title="174"> </a>mass, hatching is produced, and the young emerge
	from their primitive nest.</p>

	<div id="fig24" class="figright">

		<p class="caption"><a href="#fig24mark">Fig. 24.</a></p>
	</div>

	<p>Birds are not alone in constructing temporary
	dwellings in which to lay their eggs; some Fish are
	equally artistic in this kind of industry, and even
	certain Reptiles. The Alligator of the Mississippi
	would not perhaps at first be regarded as a model
	of maternal foresight. Yet the female constructs a
	genuine nest. She seeks a very inaccessible spot in
	the midst of brushwood and thickets of reeds. With
	her jaw she carries thither boughs which she arranges
	on the soil and
	covers with leaves.
	She lays her eggs
	and conceals them
	with care beneath
	vegetable remains.
	Not yet considering
	her work completed,
	she stays in
	the neighbourhood
	watching with jealous
	eye the thicket
	which shelters the dear deposit, and never ceases to
	mount guard threateningly until the day when her
	young ones can follow her into the stream.</p>

	<p>A hymenopterous relative of the Bees, the <em lang="la" xml:lang="la">Megachile</em>,
	cuts out in rose-leaves fragments of appropriate form
	which it bears away to a small hole in a tree, an
	abandoned mouse nest or some similar cavity. There
	it rolls them, works them up, and arranges them with
	much art, so as to manufacture what resemble thimbles,
	which it fills with honey and in which it lays.<a href="#footnote_89" id="fnm89"  class="fnmarker">89</a> (<a href="#fig24" id="fig24mark">Fig. 24.</a>)</p>

	<p><a class="pagenum" id="page175" title="175"> </a>The <em lang="la" xml:lang="la">Anthocopa</em> acts in a similar manner, carpeting
	the holes of which it takes possession with the delicate
	petals of the corn poppy.</p>

	<p>The retreats of nocturnal birds of prey do not
	differ in method of construction from these two kinds
	of nests. They are holes in trees, in ruins, in old walls,
	and are lined with soft and warm material. These
	dwellings are related, not to the type of the hollowed
	cave, but to that of the habitation manufactured
	from mingled materials. They constitute an inferior
	form in which the pieces are not firmly bound together
	but need support throughout. The cavity is the
	support which sustains the real house.</p>

	<p><em id="ch_6_11" class="section_title">Dwellings formed of coarsely-entangled materials.</em> — Diurnal
	birds of prey are the first animals who
	practise skilfully the twining of materials. Their
	nests, which have received the name of eyries, are
	not yet masterpieces of architecture, and reveal the
	beginning of the industry which is pushed so far by
	other birds. Usually situated in wild and inaccessible
	spots, the young are there in safety when their
	parents are away on distant expeditions. The abrupt
	summits of cliffs and the tops of the highest forest
	trees are the favourite spots chosen by the great birds
	of prey. The eyrie generally consists of a mass of
	dry branches which cross and mutually support one
	another, constituting a whole which is fairly resistant.</p>

	<p>Even these primitive nests are not, however, without
	more complicated details of interest. Thus Mr.
	Denis Gale wrote to Bendire concerning the Golden
	Eagle in America: “Here in Colorado, in the
	numerous glades running from the valleys into the
	foothills, high inaccessible ledges are quite frequently
	met with which afford the Eagles secure sites for their
	<a class="pagenum" id="page176" title="176"> </a>enormous nests. I know of one nest that must
	contain two waggon-loads of material. It is over
	seven feet high, and quite six feet wide on its upper
	surface. In most cases the cliff above overhangs the
	site. At the end of February or the beginning of
	March, the needful repairs to the nest are attended
	to, and the universal branch of evergreen is laid upon
	the nest, seemingly for any purpose save that of
	utility. This feature has been present in all the nests
	I have examined myself, or have had examined by
	others; it would seem to be employed as a badge of
	occupancy.”<a href="#footnote_90" id="fnm90"  class="fnmarker">90</a> This curious feature is also found in the
	nests of the Bald or American Eagle. Thus Dr. W. L.
	Ralph furnished Bendire with the following observations
	made in Florida on the dwellings of this, the
	national bird of the United States: — “The nests are
	immense structures, from five to six feet in diameter,
	and about the same in depth, and so strong that a man
	can walk around in one without danger of breaking
	through; in fact, my assistant would always get in
	the nest before letting the eggs down to me. They
	are composed of sticks, some of which are two or
	three inches thick, and are lined with marsh grass
	or some similar material. There is usually a slight
	depression in the centre, where the eggs are placed,
	but the edge of the nest extends so far beyond this
	that it is almost impossible to see the bird from
	below, unless it has its head well up. I have frequently
	found foreign substances in their nests,
	usually placed on the edges of it, the object of which
	I cannot account for. Often it would be a ball of
	grass, wet or dry, sometimes a green branch from a
	pine tree, and again a piece of wood, bark, or other
	<a class="pagenum" id="page177" title="177"> </a>material. It seemed as if they were placed in
	the nests as if to mark them. From its frequent
	occurrence, at least, it seemed to me as if designedly
	done.”<a href="#footnote_91" id="fnm91"  class="fnmarker">91</a></p>

	<p>The abodes of Squirrels, though exhibiting more
	art, are constructions of the same nature; that is to
	say, they are formed of interlaced sticks. This
	animal builds its home to shelter itself there in the
	bad season, to pass the night in it, and to rear its
	young. Very agile, and not afraid of climbing, it
	places its domicile near the tops of our highest forest
	trees. Rather capricious also, and desiring change of
	residence from time to time, it builds several of them;
	at least three or four, sometimes more. The materials
	which it needs are collected on the earth among fallen
	dead branches, or are torn away from the old
	abandoned nest of a crow or some other bird. The
	Squirrel firsts builds a rather hollow floor by intermingling
	the fragments of wood which it has brought.
	In this state its dwelling resembles a magpie’s nest.
	But the fastidious little animal wishes to be better
	protected and not thus to sleep in the open air. Over
	this foundation he raises a conical roof; the sticks
	which form it are very skilfully disposed, and so well
	interlaced that the whole is impenetrable to rain.
	The house must still be furnished, and this is done
	with oriental luxury; that is to say, the entire furniture
	consists of a carpet, a carpet of very dry moss,
	which the Squirrel tears from the trunks of trees, and
	which it piles up so as to have a soft and warm
	couch. An entrance situated at the lower part gives
	access to the aërial castle; it is usually directed
	towards the east. On the opposite side there is
	<a class="pagenum" id="page178" title="178"> </a>another orifice by which the animal can escape if an
	enemy should invade the principal entrance. In
	ordinary times also it serves to ventilate the chamber
	by setting up a slight current of air. The Squirrel
	greatly fears storms and rain, and during bad
	weather hastens to take refuge in his dwelling. If
	the wind blows in the direction of the openings,
	the little beast at once closes them with two stoppers
	of moss, and keeps well shut in as long as the
	storm rages.</p>

	<p>The great Anthropoid Apes have found nothing
	better for shelter than the Squirrels’ method. It
	must, however, be taken into account that they have
	much more difficulty in arranging and maintaining
	much heavier rooms, and in building up a shelter with
	larger surface.</p>

	<p>The Orang-outang, which lives in the virgin forests
	of the Sunda Archipelago, does not feel the need of
	constructing a roof against the rain. He is content
	with a floor established in the midst of a tree, and
	made of broken and interlaced branches. He piles
	up on this support a considerable mass of leaves and
	moss; for the Orang does not sleep seated like the
	other great apes, but lies down in the manner of Man,
	as has often been observed when he is in captivity.
	When he feels the cold he is ingenious enough to
	cover himself with the leaves of his couch.</p>

	<p>In Upper and Lower Guinea the Chimpanzee
	(<em lang="la" xml:lang="la">Troglodytes niger</em>) also establishes his dwelling on
	trees. He first makes choice of a large horizontal
	branch, which constitutes a sufficient floor for the
	agile animal. Above this branch he bends the
	neighbouring boughs, crosses them, and interlaces
	them so as to obtain a sort of framework. When
	<a class="pagenum" id="page179" title="179"> </a>this preliminary labour is accomplished, he collects
	dead wood or breaks up branches and adds them to
	the first. Before commencing he had taken care
	when choosing the site that the whole was so
	arranged that a fork was within reach to sustain the
	roof. He thus constructs a very sufficient shelter.
	These apes are sociable and prefer to live in each
	other’s neighbourhood. They even go on excursions
	in rather large bands. Notwithstanding this, more
	than one or two cabins are never seen on the same
	tree; perhaps this is because the complicated conditions
	required for the construction are not likely
	to be realised several times on the same tree;
	perhaps also it is a desire for independence which
	impels the Chimpanzees not to live too near to each
	other.<a href="#footnote_92" id="fnm92"  class="fnmarker">92</a></p>

	<p>The <em lang="la" xml:lang="la">Troglodytes calvus</em>, a relative of the preceding,
	inhabiting the same regions, as described by Du
	Chaillu, shows still more skill in raising his roof. A
	tree is always chosen for support. He breaks off
	boughs and fastens them by one end to the trunk, by
	the other to a large branch. To fix all these pieces
	he employs very strong creepers, which grow in
	abundance in his forests. Above this framework, which
	indicates remarkable ingenuity, the animal piles up
	large leaves, forming in layers well pressed down and
	quite impenetrable to the rain. The whole has the
	appearance of an open parasol. The ape sits on a
	branch beneath his handiwork, supporting himself
	against the trunk with one arm. He has thus an
	excellent shelter against the mid-day sun as well as
	against tropical showers. Male and female each
	<a class="pagenum" id="page180" title="180"> </a>possess a dwelling on two neighbouring trees, the
	principle of conjugal cohabitation not being admitted
	in this species. As to the child, it appears that it
	sleeps near its mother, until it is of age to lead an
	independent life.</p>

	<p>There exists in Australia, the country of zoological
	singularities, a bird with very curious customs. This
	is the Satin Bower-bird. The art displayed in this
	bird’s constructions is not less interesting than the
	sociability he gives evidence of, and his desire to
	have for his hours of leisure a shelter adorned to his
	taste. The bowers which he constructs, and which
	present on a small scale the appearance of the arbours
	in our old gardens, are places for re-union and for
	warbling and courtship, in which the birds stay during
	the day, when no anxiety leads them to disperse.
	They are not, properly speaking, nests built for the
	purpose of rearing young; for at the epoch of love
	each couple separates and constructs a special retreat
	in the neighbourhood of the bower. These shelters
	are always situated in the most retired parts of the
	forest, and are placed on the earth at the foot of trees.
	Several couples work together to raise the edifice, the
	males performing the chief part of the work. At first
	they establish a slightly convex floor, made with
	interlaced sticks, intended to keep the place sheltered
	from the moisture of the soil. The arbour rises in
	the centre of this first platform. Boughs vertically
	arranged are interlaced at the base with those of the
	floor. The birds arrange them in two rows facing
	each other; they then curve together the upper
	extremities of these sticks, and fix them so as to
	obtain a vault. All the prominences in the materials
	employed are turned towards the outside, so that the
	<a class="pagenum" id="page181" title="181"> </a>interior of the room may be smooth and the birds
	may not catch their plumage in it. This done, the
	little architects, to embellish their retreat, transport
	to it a number of conspicuous objects, such as very
	white stones from a neighbouring stream, shells, the
	bright feathers of the parroquet, whatever comes to
	their beak. All these treasures are arranged on the
	earth, before the two entries to the bower, so as to
	form on each side a carpet, which is not smooth, but
	the varied colours of which rejoice the eye. The
	prettiest treasures are fixed into the wall of the hut.
	These houses of pleasure, with all their adornments,
	form a dwelling very much to the taste of this
	winged folk, and the birds pass there the greater
	part of the day, preening their feathers and narrating
	the news of the forest. Bower-birds’ clubs
	are drawing-rooms raised at the common expense by
	all who frequent them. The Spotted Bower-bird, the
	<em lang="la" xml:lang="la">Chlamydera maculata</em>, which also lives in the interior
	of Australia, exercises this method of construction
	with equal success. The bowers built by these birds
	may be one metre in length; this is on a very
	luxurious scale, the animal itself only measuring
	twenty-five centimetres. In this species, as among
	other Bower-birds, the bowers are not the labour and
	the property of a single couple; they are the result
	of the collaboration of several households, who come
	together to shelter themselves there. These birds
	feed only on grains, so that it is to a very pronounced
	taste for collecting that we must attribute
	this mania of piling up before the entrance of the
	bower white stones, shells, and small bones. (<a href="#fig25" id="fig25mark">Fig. 25.</a>)
	These objects are intended solely for the
	delight of these feathered artists. They are very
	<a class="pagenum" id="page182" title="182"> </a>careful also only to collect pieces which have been
	whitened and dried by the sun.<a href="#footnote_93" id="fnm93"  class="fnmarker">93</a></p>

	<p>Certain Humming-birds also, according to Gould,
	decorate their dwellings with great taste. “They
	instinctively fasten thereon,” he stated, “beautiful
	pieces of flat lichen, the larger pieces in the middle,
	and the smaller on the part attached to the branch.
	Now and then a pretty feather is intertwined or
	fastened to the outer sides, the stem being always
	so placed that the feather stands out beyond the
	surface.”<a href="#footnote_94" id="fnm94"  class="fnmarker">94</a></p>

	<p><em id="ch_6_12" class="section_title">Dwellings woven of flexible substances.</em> — In spite of
	their lack of skill and the inadequacy of their organs
	for this kind of work, Fish are not the most awkward
	architects. The species which construct nests for
	laying in are fairly numerous; the classical case of
	the Stickleback is always quoted, but this is not the
	only animal of its class to possess the secret of the
	manufacture of a shelter for its eggs.</p>

	<p>A fish of Java, the Gourami (<em lang="la" xml:lang="la">Osphronemus olfax</em>),
	establishes an ovoid nest with the leaves of aquatic
	plants woven together. It makes its work about the
	size of a fist, takes no rest until it is completed, and
	is able to finish it in five or six days. It is the male
	alone who weaves this dwelling; when it is ready a
	female comes to lay there, and generally fills it; it
	may contain from six hundred to a thousand eggs.</p>

	<div id="fig25" class="figcenter"><a class="pagenum" id="page183" title="183"> </a>

		<p class="caption"><a href="#fig25mark">Fig. 25.</a></p>
	</div>

	<p>In the sea of Sargasso lives a fish which has received
	the name of the <em lang="la" xml:lang="la">Antennarius marmoratus</em>. Its
	<a class="pagenum" id="page184" title="184"> </a>flattened and monstrous head gives it a strange
	aspect, and it is marbled with brown and yellow.
	These colours are those of the tufts of floating seaweed
	around it, and, thanks to this arrangement, it
	can easily hide itself amid them without being recognised
	from afar. This animal constructs for its
	offspring a fairly safe retreat. The materials which it
	employs are tufts of Sargasso so abundant in this portion
	of the Atlantic. It collects all the filaments, and
	unites them solidly by surrounding them with viscous
	mucus which it secretes and which hardens. When its
	work is sufficiently firm not to be destroyed by the
	waves it lays its eggs in it, and the floating nest is
	abandoned to its fate. The little ones come out and
	find within it a sufficient protection for their early
	age. These dwellings thus floating on the surface
	of the sea are rounded and about the size of a
	cocoa-nut.</p>

	<p>In Guiana and Brazil another species, the <em lang="la" xml:lang="la">Chœstostomus
	pictus</em>, is found, which is equally skilful. With
	aquatic plants it constructs a spherical nest and
	arranges it in the midst of the reeds, level with the
	water. At the lower part a hole is left, through which
	the female comes to lay. After fertilisation, the couple,
	as is rarely found among fish, remain in the neighbourhood
	of their offspring to assist them if necessary.
	This praiseworthy sentiment is often the cause of
	their ruin. The inhabitants of the banks speculate on
	the love of these fish for their offspring to gain
	possession of them. It is sufficient to place a basket
	near the entrance of the dwelling, which is then lightly
	struck. The animal, threatened in its affections, darts
	furiously forward with bristling spines and throws
	itself into the trap.</p>

	<p><a class="pagenum" id="page185" title="185"> </a>It is scarcely necessary to recall the skilful art with
	which the Stickleback which inhabits all our streams
	plaits its nest and remains sentinel near it. (<a href="#fig26" id="fig26mark">Fig. 26.</a>)
	This fish has indeed monopolised our admiration,
	and is considered as the most skilful, if not the
	only aquatic architect. Yet, besides those which I have
	already mentioned, there is one which equals the
	Stickleback in the skill it displays in constructing a
	shelter for its spawn. This is the <em lang="la" xml:lang="la">Gobius niger</em> met
	on our coasts, especially in the estuaries of rivers.
	The male interlaces and weaves the leaves of algæ,
	etc., and when he has finished his preparations, he
	goes to seek females, and leads them one by one to
	lay in the retreat he has built. Then he remains in
	the neighbourhood until the young come out, ready
	to throw himself furiously with his spines on any
	imprudent intruders.</p>

	<p><em id="ch_6_13" class="section_title">Dwellings woven with greater art.</em> — Without doubt
	the class of Birds furnishes the most expert artisans
	in the industry of the woven dwelling. In our own
	country we may see them seeking every day to right
	and left, carrying a morsel of straw, a pinch of moss,
	a hair from a horse’s tail, or a tuft of wool caught in
	a bush. They intermingle these materials, making the
	framework of the construction with the coarser pieces,
	keeping those that are warmer and more delicate for
	the interior. These nests, attached to a fork in a
	branch or in a shrub, hidden in the depth of a thicket,
	are little masterpieces of skill and patience. To
	describe every form and every method would fill a
	volume. But I cannot pass in silence those which
	reveal a science sure of itself, and which are not very
	inferior to what man can do in this line. The
	Lithuanian Titmouse (<em lang="la" xml:lang="la">Ægithalus pendulinus</em>), whose
	<a class="pagenum" id="page187" title="187"> </a>works have been well described by Baldamus, lives in
	the marshes in the midst of reeds and willows in
	Poland, Galicia, and Hungary. Its nest, which
	resembles none met in our own country, is always
	suspended above the water, two or three metres above
	the surface, fixed to a willow branch.<a href="#footnote_95" id="fnm95"  class="fnmarker">95</a> All individuals
	do not exhibit the same skill in fabricating their
	dwelling; some are more careful and clever than
	others who are less experienced. Some also are
	obliged by circumstances to hasten their work. It
	frequently happens that Magpies spoil or even
	altogether destroy with blows of their beaks one of
	these pretty nests. The unfortunate couple are
	obliged to recommence their task, and if this accident
	happens two or three times to the same household, it
	can easily be imagined that, discouraged and depressed
	by the advancing season, they hasten to build a shelter
	anyhow, only doing what is indispensable, and neglecting
	perfection. However this may be, the nests
	which are properly finished have the form of a
	purse, twenty centimetres high and twelve broad.
	(<a href="#fig27" id="fig27mark">Fig. 27.</a>) At the side an opening, prolonged by a
	passage which is generally horizontal, gives access to
	the interior. Sometimes another opening is found
	without any passage. Every nest in the course of
	construction possessed this second entry, but it is
	usually filled up when the work is completed. When
	the bird has resolved to establish its retreat, it first
	chooses a hanging branch presenting bifurcations
	which can be utilised as a rigid frame on which to
	weave the lateral walls of the habitation. It intercrosses
	wool and goat’s hair so as to form two courses
	which are afterwards united to each other below, and
	<a class="pagenum" id="page189" title="189"> </a>constitute the first sketch of the nest, at this moment
	like a flat-bottomed basket. This is only the beginning.
	The whole wall is reinforced by the addition of
	new material. The architect piles up down from the
	poplar and the willow, and binds it all together with
	filaments torn from the bark of trees, so as to make
	a whole which is very resistant. Then a couch is
	formed by heaping up wool and down at the bottom
	of the nest.</p>

	<p>The American Baltimore Oriole, also called the Baltimore
	Bird, is a distinguished weaver. With strong
	stalks and hemp or flax, fastened round two forked
	twigs corresponding to the proposed width of nest, it
	makes a very delicate sort of mat, weaving into it
	quantities of loose tow. The form of the nest might
	be compared to that of a ham; it is attached by the
	narrow portion to a small branch, the large part being
	below. An opening exists at the lower end of the
	dwelling, and the interior is carefully lined with soft
	substances, well interwoven with the outward netting,
	and it is finished with an external layer of horse-hair,
	while the whole is protected from sun and rain by a
	natural canopy of leaves.</p>

	</div>

	<p>The Rufous-necked Weaver Bird, as described by
	Brehm, shows itself equally clever. Its nest is woven
	with extreme delicacy, and resembles a long-necked
	decanter hung up with the opening below. From the
	bottom of the decanter a strong band attaches the
	whole to the branch of a tree. (<a href="#fig28" id="fig28mark">Fig. 28.</a>) The
	Yellow Weaver Bird of Java, as described by Forbes,
	constructs very similar retort-shaped nests.<a href="#footnote_96" id="fnm96"  class="fnmarker">96</a></p>

	<p>These birds have no monopoly of these careful
	<a class="pagenum" id="page190" title="190"> </a>dwellings; a considerable number of genera have
	carried this industry to the same degree of perfection.</p>

	</div>

	<p>When animals apply themselves in association to
	any work, they nearly always exhibit in it a marked
	superiority over neighbouring species among whom
	the individuals work in isolation. The construction of
	dwellings is no exception, and the nests of the Sociable
	Weaver Birds of South Africa are the best constructed
	that can be found. These birds live together in considerable
	colonies; the members of an association are
	at least two hundred in number, and sometimes rise
	to five hundred. The city which they construct is a
	<a class="pagenum" id="page191" title="191"> </a>marvel of industry. They first make with grass a
	sloping roof; giving it the form of a mushroom or an
	open umbrella, and they place it in such a way that
	it is supported by the trunk of a tree and one or two
	of the branches. (<a href="#fig29" id="fig29mark">Fig. 29.</a>) This thatch is prepared
	with so much care that it is absolutely impenetrable
	to water. Beneath this protecting shelter
	each couple constructs its private dwelling. All the
	individual nests have their openings below, and they
	<a class="pagenum" id="page192" title="192"> </a>are so closely pressed against one another that on
	looking at the construction from beneath, the divisions
	cannot be seen. One only perceives a surface riddled
	with holes like a skimmer; each of these holes is the
	door of a nest. The work may endure for several
	years; as long as there is room beneath the roof the
	young form pairs near their cradle; but at last, as the
	colony continues to increase, a portion emigrate to
	found a new town on another tree in the forest.<a href="#footnote_97" id="fnm97"  class="fnmarker">97</a></p>

	<div id="fig30" class="figright">
		<a href="images/fig_30.png"><img src="images/th_fig_30.png" width="219" height="283" alt="Two mice sit atop a woven nest." /></a>
		<p class="caption"><a href="#fig30mark">Fig. 30.</a></p>
	</div>

	<p>The industry of the woven dwelling does not
	flourish among mammals; but there is one which
	excels in it. This is the Dwarf Mouse (<em lang="la" xml:lang="la">Mus minutus</em>),
	certainly one of the smallest Rodents. It generally
	lives amidst reeds and rushes, and it is perhaps this
	circumstance which has impelled it to construct an
	aërial dwelling for its young, not being able to deposit
	them on the damp and often flooded soil. This
	retreat is not used in every season; its sole object
	is for bringing forth the young. It is therefore a
	genuine nest, not only by the manner in which it is
	made, but by the object it is intended to serve. The
	mouse chooses in the midst of its usual domain a tuft
	with leaves more or less crossed; but not too inextricable,
	so that there may remain in the midst an
	empty space, in the centre of which the work will be
	arranged. Great ingenuity is shown in the preliminaries;
	the mouse simplifies its task by utilising
	material within its reach instead of going afar to
	collect them with trouble. The little animal examines
	the thicket, and on reflection chooses some
	<a class="pagenum" id="page193" title="193"> </a>thirty leaves which appear suitable. Then, without
	detaching them, it tears each into seven or eight
	threads which are held together by the base, and
	remain attached to the reeds. It is a clever idea to
	avoid losing a natural point of support. The little
	bands being thus prepared, they are interlaced and
	crossed with much art, the animal comes and goes,
	placing first one of them, then another above, taken
	from a different leaf. It has soon woven a ball about
	<a class="pagenum" id="page194" title="194"> </a>the size of the fist, and hollowed out the interior.
	(<a href="#fig30" id="fig30mark">Fig. 30.</a>) Delicate materials are not lacking around
	to make a soft bed. The mouse gleans and constantly
	brings in the light down of the willow,
	grains with cottony crests, and the petals of flowers.
	This is all carefully fitted, and when the edifice is
	completed the female retires into it to bring forth
	her young, which are there well sheltered against the
	dangers without, and the caprices of storms and
	floods. The nest is made with as much delicacy as
	that of any bird, and no other mammal except Man
	is capable of executing such weaver’s work.</p>

	<p><em id="ch_6_14" class="section_title">The art of sewing among birds.</em> — There are birds
	which have succeeded in solving a remarkable difficulty.
	Sewing seems so ingenious an art that it must
	be reserved for the human species alone. Yet the
	Tailor Bird, the <em lang="la" xml:lang="la">Orthotomus longicauda</em>, and other
	species possess the elements of it. They place their
	nests in a large leaf which they prepare to this end.
	With their beaks they pierce two rows of holes along
	the two edges of the leaf; they then pass a stout
	thread from one side to the other alternately. With
	this leaf, at first flat, they form a horn in which they
	weave their nest with cotton or hair. (<a href="#fig31" id="fig31mark">Fig. 31.</a>)
	These labours of weaving and sewing are preceded
	by the spinning of the thread. The bird makes it
	itself by twisting in its beak spiders’ webs, bits of
	cotton, and little ends of wool. Sykes found that the
	threads used for sewing were knotted at the ends.<a href="#footnote_98" id="fnm98"  class="fnmarker">98</a>
	It is impossible not to admire animals who have
	skilfully triumphed over all the obstacles met with
	in the course of these complicated operations.<a href="#footnote_99" id="fnm99"  class="fnmarker">99</a></p>

	</div>

	<p><a class="pagenum" id="page195" title="195"> </a>Certain Spiders, while they do not actually
	sew in the sense that they perforate the leaves
	they use to build their nest, and draw the thread

	<p><em id="ch_6_15" class="section_title">Modifications of dwellings according to season and
	climate.</em> — A certain number of facts show that these
	various industries are not fixed and immutable instincts
	imposed on the species. Certain Birds change
	the form of their dwelling according to the climate,
	or according to the season in which they inhabit it.
	For example, the Crossbill, <em lang="la" xml:lang="la">Loxia tænioptera</em> (<a href="#fig32" id="fig32mark">Fig. 32</a>),
	does not build its nest according to the same rules
	in Sweden as in France. It builds in every season.
	The winter shelter is spherical, constructed with very
	dry lichens, and it is very large. A very narrow
	opening, just sufficient for the passage of the owner,
	prevents the external cold from penetrating within.
	The summer nests are much smaller, in consequence
	of a reduction in the thickness of the walls. There is
	no longer need to fear that the cold will come through
	them, and the animal gives itself no superfluous
	trouble.</p>

	</div>

	<p>Again, the Baltimore Oriole, which inhabits both the
	Northern and Southern States of North America, knows
	very well how to adapt his manner of work to the
	external circumstances in which he lives. Thus, in
	the Southern States the nest is woven of delicate
	materials united in a rather loose fashion, so that the
	air can circulate freely and keep the interior fresh;
	it is lined with no warm substance, and the entrance
	is turned to the west so that the sun only sends into
	it the oblique evening rays. In the north, on the
	contrary, the nest is oriented to the south to profit by
	all the warm sunshine; the walls are thick, without
	<a class="pagenum" id="page197" title="197"> </a>interstices, and the dwelling is carpeted in the warmest
	and softest manner. Even in the same region
	there is great diversity in the style, neatness, and
	finish of the
	nests, as well as
	in the materials
	used. Skeins
	of silk and
	hanks of thread
	have frequently
	been found in
	the Baltimore
	Bird’s nest, so
	woven up and
	entangled that
	they could not
	be withdrawn.
	As such materials
	could
	not be obtained
	before the introduction
	of
	Europeans, it
	is evident that
	this bird, with
	the sagacity of
	a good architect,
	knows how
	to select the
	strongest and
	best materials for his work. Many other facts might
	be quoted, but these suffice to show that the species
	is not animated by an inevitable instinct, but that each
	individual, skilful no doubt by heredity, can modify the
	<a class="pagenum" id="page198" title="198"> </a>methods transmitted to him by his ancestors, according
	to his own experience and his own judgment.</p>

	<p><em id="ch_6_16" class="section_title">Built dwellings.</em> — The built dwelling, the expression
	of the highest civilisation, still remains to be studied.
	Man has only known how to construct this kind of
	shelter at a comparatively late period in his evolution;
	and among animals we do not find it widely spread,
	much less so, certainly, than the two foregoing methods,
	especially the first. The difficulty of this work is
	greater, and it only arrives at considerable development
	among very sociable species, since the united
	efforts of a great number of individuals are needed to
	carry it on.</p>

	<p>There are, however, masons who operate separately;
	but their constructions are rudimentary. The characteristic
	of all these works is that they are manufactured
	with some substance to which the animal
	gives a determined form while it is still soft, and that
	in drying it preserves this form and acquires solidity.
	The matter most usually employed is softened and
	tempered earth — mortar; but there are animals who
	use with success more delicate bodies. Two examples
	will suffice to indicate the nature of these exceptions:
	the labours of Wasps and those of certain Swallows.</p>

	<div id="fig33" class="figcenter"><a class="pagenum disguise" id="page199" title="199"> </a>
		<a href="images/fig_33.png"><img src="images/th_fig_33.png" width="261" height="402" alt="Wasps outside a nest." /></a>
		<p class="caption"><a href="#fig33mark">Fig. 33.</a></p>
	</div>

	<p><em id="ch_6_17" class="section_title">Paper nests.</em> — Certain Wasps, by the material of
	their dwellings, approach the Japanese; they build
	with paper. This paper or cardboard is very strong
	and supplies a solid support; moreover, being a bad
	conductor of heat, it contributes to maintain an
	equable temperature within the nest. The constructions
	of these insects, though they do not exhibit the
	geometric arrangement of those of Bees, are not less
	interesting. The paper which they employ is manufactured
	on the spot, as the walls of the cells develop.
	<a class="pagenum" id="page200" title="200"> </a>Detritus of every kind enters into its
	preparation: small fragments of wood, sawdust, etc.;
	anything is good. These Hymenoptera possess no
	organ specially adapted to aid them; it is with their
	saliva that they glue this dust together and make of
	it a substance very suitable for its purpose. The
	dwellings often reach considerable size, yet they are
	always begun by a single female, who does all the
	work without help until the moment when the first
	eggs come out; she is thus furnished with workers
	capable of taking a share in her task. The <em lang="la" xml:lang="la">Vespa
	sylvestris</em> builds a paper nest of this kind, hanging to
	the branch of a tree, like a great grey sphere prolonged
to a blunt neck. (<a href="#fig33" id="fig33mark">Fig. 33.</a>) The Hornet’s
	nest is similar in construction.</p>

	<p><em id="ch_6_18" class="section_title">Gelatine nests.</em> — These are made by certain Swallows
	who nest in grottoes or cliffs on the edge of the sea.
	After having collected from the water a gelatinous
	substance formed either of the spawn of fish or the
	eggs of Mollusca, they carry this substance on to a
	perpendicular wall, and apply it to form an arc of a
	circle. This first deposit being dry, they increase it
	by sticking on to its edge a new deposit. Gradually
	the dwelling takes on the appearance of a cup and
	receives the workers’ eggs. (<a href="#fig34" id="fig34mark">Fig. 34.</a>) These dwellings
	are the famous swallows’ nests, so appreciated by the
	epicures of the extreme East, which are edible in
	the same way as, for example, caviare.</p>

	<p><em id="ch_6_19" class="section_title">Constructions built of earth — Solitary masons.</em> — Certain
	animals, whose dwelling participates in the
	nature of a hollow cavern, make additions to it
	which claim a place among the constructions with
	which we are now occupied.</p>

	<div id="fig34" class="figright">

	</div>

	<p>The <em lang="la" xml:lang="la">Anthophora parietina</em> is in this group; it is
	<a class="pagenum" id="page201" title="201"> </a>a small bee which lives in liberty in our climate. As
	its name indicates, it prefers to frequent the walls of
	old buildings and finds a refuge in the interstices,
	hollowing out the mortar half disintegrated by time.
	The entrance to the dwelling is protected by a tube
	curved towards the bottom, and making an external
	prominence. (<a href="#fig35" id="fig35mark">Fig. 35.</a>) The owner comes and goes
	by this passage, and as it is curved towards the earth
	<a class="pagenum" id="page203" title="203"> </a>the interior is protected against a flow of rain, while
	at the same time the entry is rendered more difficult
	for <em lang="la" xml:lang="la">Melectes</em> and <em lang="la" xml:lang="la">Anthrax</em>. These insects, in fact,
	watch the departure of the <em lang="la" xml:lang="la">Anthophora</em> to endeavour
	to penetrate into their nests and lay their eggs there.
	The gallery of entry and exit has been built with
	grains of sand, the <em lang="la" xml:lang="la">débris</em> produced by the insect in
	working. These grains of sand glued together form,
	on drying, a very resistant wall.<a href="#footnote_101" id="fnm101"  class="fnmarker">101</a></p>

	</div>

	<p>The other animals of which I have to speak are
	genuine masons, who prepare their mortar by tempering
	moistened earth. Every one has seen the Swallow
	in spring working at its nest in the corner of a window.
	It usually establishes its dwelling in an angle, so that
	the three existing walls can be utilised, and to have an
	enclosed space there is need only to add the face. It
	usually gives to this the form of a quarter of a sphere,
	and begins it by applying earth more or less mixed with
	chopped hay against the walls which are to support
	the edifice. At the summit of the construction a hole
	is left for entry and exit. During the whole of its
	sojourn in our country the Swallow uses this dwelling,
	and even returns to it for many years in succession,
	as long as its work will support the attacks of time.
	The faithful return of these birds to their old nest has
	been many times proved by attaching ribbons to their
	claws; they have always returned with the distinctive
	mark.</p>

	<div id="fig36" class="figright">
		<a href="images/fig_36.png"><img src="images/th_fig_36.png" width="200" height="176" alt="A cutaway view of a bee's nest, showing larvae in the cells." /></a>
		<p class="caption"><a href="#fig36mark">Fig. 36.</a></p>
	</div>

	<p>The <em lang="la" xml:lang="la">Chalicodoma</em>, whose name of Mason Bee indicates
	the industry it exercises, is a hymenopterous
	relative to our Bees, long since carefully studied by
	Réaumur. It does not live in societies like the latter,
	<a class="pagenum" id="page204" title="204"> </a>and exhibits individual initiative and skill as great
	as the swallows. The females accomplish the work
	which I am about to describe. The little cells which
	they build are arranged, to the number of eight or
	ten together, in the most various places; sometimes
	on a pebble, sometimes on a branch, or, again, on a
	stone wall. (<a href="#fig36" id="fig36mark">Fig. 36.</a>) The insect collects earth as
	fine as possible, such as the dust of a trodden path,
	and tempers it with its own saliva. It places side
	by side these little balls of mortar and the work soon
	takes the form of a cupola, to the edge of which it
	constantly adds new deposits. The sun quickly dries
	the hole and gives it the necessary consistence.
	When the cell has acquired sufficient height, the
	<em lang="la" xml:lang="la">Chalicodoma</em> abandons its occupation of mason, and
	visits flowers for pollen and nectar wherewith to fill
	the little chamber. It goes back to the nest, disgorges
	its supply, and returns to the field, until the
	<a class="pagenum" id="page205" title="205"> </a>little cup of earth is full to the edge. When the
	dwelling is thus prepared and provisioned, the insect
	lays an egg there and closes the upper part with a
	vault, built by successive deposits over the opening,
	which is more and more narrowed until it is finally
	shut up. Having completed a chamber, it passes on
	to the next, and so on until it has assured the fate of
	all its descendants.</p>

	<p>This hymenopterous insect certainly shows in its acts
	as an artisan an inevitable instinct: hereditary intelligence
	has become less personal and less spontaneous.
	In certain cases, however, the instinct loses its rigidity
	and automatism. Thus, when a <em lang="la" xml:lang="la">Chalicodoma</em>, at the
	moment of preparing to accomplish its task, finds an
	old nest, still capable of repair although dilapidated,
	it does not hesitate to take possession of it and to
	silence its assumed innate instinct of building. It
	profits by the work already done, and is content to
	fill up the cracks or to re-establish the masonry where
	defective; then it provisions the renewed cells with
	honey, and lays its eggs in them. In certain circumstances
	it shows itself still more sparing of trouble,
	and boldly rebels against the law which seems to be
	imposed on it by nature. If it feels itself sufficiently
	strong, the <em lang="la" xml:lang="la">Chalicodoma</em> throws itself on one of its
	fellows, a peaceful constructor that has almost completed
	its work; it chases it away, and takes possession
	of its property to shelter its own eggs. Instead of
	manufacturing the cell from bottom to top, it has
	only to complete it. Such acts evidently show the
	reflection appearing through instinct.</p>

	<p>Besides the Swallows, of which I have already
	spoken, birds offer us several types of skilful construction
	with tempered earth.</p>

	<p><a class="pagenum" id="page206" title="206"> </a>The Flamingo, which lives in marshes, cannot
	place its eggs on the earth nor in the trunks of trees,
	which are often absent from its domain. It builds a
	cone of mud, which dries and becomes very resistant,
	and it prepares at the summit an excavation open to
	the air; this is the nest. The female broods by
	sitting with her legs hanging over the sides of the
	hillock on which her little family prospers above the
	waters and the damp soil.</p>

	<p>A Perch in the Danube also manufactures a dwelling
	of dried earth. It gives it the form of an elliptic
	cupola, and prepares a semicircular opening for
	entry and exit.</p>

	<p>The bird which shows itself the most skilful mason
	is probably the Oven-Bird (<em lang="la" xml:lang="la">Furnarius rufus</em>) of
	Brazil and La Plata. Its name is owing to the form
	of the nest which it constructs for brooding, and which
	has the appearance of an oven. It is very skilful and
	knows how to build a dome of clay without scaffolding,
	which is not altogether easy. Having chosen for the
	site of its labours a large horizontal branch, it brings
	to it a number of little clay balls more or less combined
	with vegetable <em lang="la" xml:lang="la">débris</em>, works them altogether,
	and makes a very uniform floor, which is to serve as a
	platform for the rest of the work. When this is done,
	and while the foundation is drying, the bird arranges
	on it a circular border of mortar slightly inclined outwards.
	This becomes hard; it raises it by a new
	application, this time inclined inwards. All the other
	layers which will be placed above this will also be
	inclined towards the interior of the chamber. As the
	structure rises, the circle which terminates it above
	becomes more and more narrow. Soon it is quite
	small, and the animal, closing it with a little ball of
	<a class="pagenum" id="page207" title="207"> </a>clay, finds itself in possession of a well-made dome.
	Naturally it prepares an entrance; the form of this is
	semicircular. But this is not all. In the interior it
	arranges two partitions: one vertical, the other horizontal,
	separating off a small chamber. The vertical
	partition begins at one of the edges of the door, so
	that the air from without cannot penetrate directly
	into the dwelling, which is thus protected against
	extreme variations of temperature. It is in the compartment
	thus formed that the female lays her eggs
	and broods, after having taken care to carpet it with
	a thick layer of small herbs.</p>

	<p>“In favourable seasons, the Oven-birds begin building
	in the autumn,” Hudson tells us, “and the work is
	resumed during the winter whenever there is a spell
	of mild, wet weather. Some of their structures are
	finished early in winter, others not until spring, everything
	depending on the weather and the condition of
	the birds. In cold, dry weather, and when food is
	scarce, they do not work at all. The site chosen is a
	stout horizontal branch, or the top of a post, and they
	also frequently build on a cornice or the roof of a
	house; and sometimes, but rarely, on the ground.
	The material used is mud, with the addition of horse
	hair or slender fibrous rootlets, which make the
	structure harder and prevent it from cracking. I have
	frequently seen a bird engaged in building first pick
	up a thread or hair, then repair to a puddle, where it
	was worked into a pellet of mud about the size of a
	filbert, then carried to the nest. When finished the
	structure is shaped outwardly like a baker’s oven, only
	with a deeper and narrower entrance. It is always
	placed very conspicuously, and with the entrance
	facing a building, if one be near, or if at a roadside it
	<a class="pagenum" id="page208" title="208"> </a>looks towards the road; the reason for this being, no
	doubt, that the bird keeps a continuous eye on the
	movements of people near it while building, and
	so leaves the nest opened and unfinished on that side
	until the last, and then the entrance is necessarily
	formed. When the structure has assumed the globular
	form with only a narrow opening, the wall on one
	side is curved inwards, reaching from the floor to the
	dome, and at the inner extremity an aperture is left
	to admit the bird to the interior or second chamber,
	in which the eggs are laid. A man’s hand fits easily
	into the first or entrance chamber, but cannot be
	twisted about so as to reach the eggs in the interior
	cavity, the entrance being so small and high up. The
	interior is lined with dry soft grass, and five white
	pear-shaped eggs are laid. The oven is a foot or
	more in diameter, and is sometimes very massive,
	weighing eight or nine pounds, and so strong that,
	unless loosened by the swaying of the branch, it often
	remains unharmed for two or three years. A new
	oven is built every year, and I have more than once
	seen a second oven built on the top of the first, when
	this has been placed very advantageously, as on a
	projection and against a wall.”<a href="#footnote_102" id="fnm102"  class="fnmarker">102</a></p>

	<p><em id="ch_6_20" class="section_title">Masons working in association.</em> — Ants have already
	furnished us with numerous proofs of their intelligence
	and their prodigious industry. So remote from Man
	from the anatomical point of view, they are of all
	animals those whose psychic faculties bring them
	nearest to him. Sociable like him, they have undergone
	<a class="pagenum" id="page209" title="209"> </a>an evolution parallel to his which has placed
	them at the head of Insects in the same way as he
	has become superior to all other Mammals. The
	brain in Ants as in Man has undergone a disproportionate
	development. Like Man, they possess a
	language which enables them to combine their efforts,
	and there is no human industry in which these insects
	have not arrived at a high degree of perfection. If in
	certain parts of the earth human societies are superior
	to those of Ants, in many others the civilisation of
	Ants is notably superior. No village of Kaffirs
	can be compared to a palace of the Termites. The
	classifications separate these insects (sometimes called
	“White Ants”) from the Ants, since the latter are
	Hymenoptera, while the former are ranked among the
	Neuroptera, but their constructions are almost alike,
	and may be described together. These small animals,
	relatively to their size, build on a colossal scale compared
	to Man; even our most exceptional monuments
	cannot be placed beside their ordinary buildings.
	(<a href="#fig37" id="fig37mark">Fig. 37.</a>) The domes of triturated and plastered clay
	which cover their nests may rise to a height of five
	metres; that is to say, to dimensions equal to one
	thousand times the length of the worker. The Eiffel
	Tower, the most elevated monument of which human
	industry can boast, is only one hundred and eighty-seven
	times the average height of the worker. It is
	three hundred metres high, but to equal the Termites’
	audacity, it would have to attain a height of 1,600
	metres.</p>

	<p>The different species of Termite are not equally
	industrious. The <em lang="la" xml:lang="la">T. bellicosus</em> seems to have carried
	the art of construction to the highest point. All the
	individuals of the species are not alike; there exists
	<a class="pagenum" id="page211" title="211"> </a>a polymorphism which produces creatures of three
	sorts: 1, the <em>soldiers</em>, recognised by their large heads
	and long sharp mandibles, moved by powerful
	muscles; it is their mission to defend the whole
	colony against its adversaries, and the wounds they
	can produce, fatal to creatures of their own size, are
	painful even to man; 2, the <em>workers</em>, who labour as
	navvies and architects, and take charge of the pupæ:
	they form the great majority of the community; 3, the
	<em>king</em> and <em>queen</em>. (<a href="#fig38" id="fig38mark">Fig. 38.</a>) To each nest there is
	usually only a single fertile and lazy couple. These
	two personages do absolutely nothing; the soldiers
	and the workers care for them and bring them food.
	They have both possessed wings, but these fall off.
	The queen reigns but does not govern; she lays.
	The king is simply the husband of the queen. The
	internal administration of the palace is bound up with
	the parts played by these three kinds of beings.</p>

	</div>

	<p><a class="pagenum" id="page212" title="212"> </a>The lofty nest, or Termitarium, constitutes a hillock
	in the form of a cupola. The interior arrangement is
	very complicated, and at the same time very well
	adapted to the life of the inhabitants. There are four
	storeys in all, covered by the general exterior walls.
	(<a href="#fig39" id="fig39mark">Fig. 39.</a>) The walls of the dome are very thick; at
	the base they measure from sixty to eighty centimetres.
	The clay in drying attains the hardness of brick, and
	the whole is very coherent. The sentinels of herds of
	wild cattle choose these tumuli as observatories and
	do not break them down. The walls of this exterior
	<em>enceinte</em> are hollowed by galleries of two kinds: some
	horizontal and giving access from outside to all the
	storeys; the others mounting spirally in the thickness
	<a class="pagenum" id="page213" title="213"> </a>of the wall to the summit of the dome. When the
	colony is in full activity, after the construction is completed,
	these little passages have no further use. They
	served for the passage of the masons when building
	the cupola; and they could be utilised again if a
	breach should be made in the wall. At the lower
	part these galleries in the wall are very wide, and they
	sink into the earth beneath the palace to a depth of
	more than 1 metre 50.</p>

	<p>These subterranean passages (<em>c</em>) are the catacombs
	of the Termites, and have a very close analogy with
	those of old and populous human cities. Their origin
	is similar; they are ancient quarries. The insects
	hollowed them in obtaining the necessary clay for
	their labours. Later, when the rains come, they serve
	as drains to carry off the water which might threaten
	to invade the dwelling.</p>

	<p>Such is the external wall within which a busy
	population swarms. On passing to the interior let us
	first enter the ground-floor. In the centre is found
	the royal chamber (<em>r</em>). The walls are extremely strong
	and are supplied with windows for ventilation, and
	with doors to enable the Termites to render their
	services. It is necessary to renew the air in this
	chamber, which constantly contains more than two
	thousand insects. The openings are large enough for
	the passage of the workers, but the queen cannot
	pass through them. She is therefore a prisoner, as
	immured as a goddess in her temple. The chain
	which holds her is the prodigious development of her
	abdomen. As a virgin she could enter, when fertilised
	she cannot henceforth go out. She continuously
	elaborates eggs; every moment one appears at the
	orifice of the oviduct. The king remains near her,
	<a class="pagenum" id="page214" title="214"> </a>to give his assistance when occasion arises; hence he
	has received the title, absolutely justified under the
	circumstances, of Father of the People. Around the
	couple zealous attendants crowd. There are about
	two thousand of them, workers and soldiers, licking
	the two royal captives to remove any dust from
	their hairs, and bringing them food. As soon as the
	queen lays an egg, one of the workers hastens to
	take it gently between its jaws; it is the property of
	the state, and is carefully carried off to the second
	storey where the state nursery is situated.</p>

	<p>The centre of the ground-floor, therefore, is occupied
	by the royal apartment; around this, and
	communicating with it by means of numerous
	entrances, are a number of cells used by the attendants
	on the queen (<em>s</em>). These little chambers are surrounded
	by a labyrinth of passages. The central
	room and its dependencies constitute a solid mass,
	around which other chambers are grouped. The
	whole space between it and the general wall is filled
	by vast storehouses, divided into many very spacious
	compartments. Within them are piled up the
	provisions which the Termites harvest every day;
	they consist especially of gums and the juices of
	plants, dried and pulverised so as to form a fine
	powder. Access to this property is given by means
	of large corridors which cross one another, and conduct
	to the outside through the horizontal galleries
	traversing the wall.</p>

	<p>Above the whole of this ground-floor rests a thick
	vault of clay, which forms a strong floor for the first
	storey (B). This is composed of only a single room;
	it is put to no use, unless to isolate and support the
	apartments of the second floor, in the arrangement of
	<a class="pagenum" id="page215" title="215"> </a>which great care is exercised. There are no partitions
	on this floor, nothing but massive columns of clay
	to support the ceiling. These columns are more than
	a metre in height. It is a gigantic cathedral in which
	the lilliputian architects have displayed considerable
	art. By means of this immense empty chamber a
	huge reservoir of air is placed in the very centre of the
	construction; through the galleries in the external
	wall it is sufficiently renewed for the purposes of
	respiration without too great a change in temperature.</p>

	<p>The second storey rests on the first. To this the
	eggs are brought, and here the larvæ go through
	their evolution. Partitions of clay divide the space
	into a few large halls (<em>a</em>); these are again subdivided,
	this time not by earth, which is employed throughout
	the rest of the building, but by materials of a more
	delicate kind, which are, moreover, very bad conductors
	of heat (<em>b</em>). It is a question, in fact, of
	maintaining these little chambers at an almost constant
	temperature, favourable for the development of
	the eggs. The substances utilised for this purpose
	are fragments of wood and of gum. The Termites
	glue them together and thus form the walls of these
	important cells.</p>

	<p>The arrangement of the top storey (D) is also
	disposed with a view of protecting the young who
	are the future of the city. It constitutes the attic,
	situated just beneath the cupola, and contains
	absolutely nothing; it simply serves to interpose
	beneath the summit of the edifice and the storey
	below a layer of air, which is a bad conductor of heat.
	The chamber devoted to the young is thus placed
	between two gaseous layers, a precaution which,
	combined with the choice of material, places it in the
	<a class="pagenum" id="page216" title="216"> </a>very best conditions for protection against the alternation
	of cold at night and torrid heat during the
	day.</p>

	<p>It is difficult to know which to admire most — the
	audacity and vastness of the labour undertaken by
	these insects, or the ingenious foresight by which they
	ensure to their delicate larvæ a comfortable youth.
	There can be no doubt that these animals show themselves
	very superior to Man, taking into consideration
	his enormous size compared to theirs, in the art of
	building. Pillars, cupolas, vaults — nothing is too
	difficult or too complicated for these small and patient
	labourers.<a href="#footnote_103" id="fnm103"  class="fnmarker">103</a></p>

	<p>The Ants of our own lands do not yield to the
	Termites in this industry, and their dwellings are
	models of architecture. As they have been more
	carefully studied we know more exactly how they
	work, and the considerable sum of intelligence and
	initiative which they reveal in the accomplishment
	of their task. At the foot of hedges, on the outskirts
	of woods, they raise their frail monuments. The
	species are not equally skilful, and such differences as
	we have found in other industries may also be found
	here. In a general manner it was soon found that
	Ants do not, like Bees, obey a rigid instinct which
	<a class="pagenum" id="page217" title="217"> </a>ordains the line of conduct under every circumstance,
	and impels each individual to act so that his efforts
	are naturally combined and harmonised with those of
	his neighbours in the workshop. One soon perceives
	when observing an ant-hill that any individual insect
	follows, when working, a personal idea which it has
	conceived, and which it realises without troubling
	itself about the others. Often these latter are executing
	a quite contradictory plan. It is rather an
	anarchistic republic. Happily Ants are not obstinate,
	and when they see the idea of one of them disengaging
	itself from the labour commenced, they are
	content to abandon their own less satisfactory idea
	and to collaborate in the other’s work. They are
	able, for the rest, to concert plans; the movements of
	their antennæ are a very complicated language containing
	many expressions, and the worker who desires the
	acceptance of his own point of view is not sparing in
	their use.<a href="#footnote_104" id="fnm104"  class="fnmarker">104</a> It sometimes happens that his efforts are
	vain, and that his companions manœuvre to thwart
	his schemes. In the presence of such resistance those
	who are determined to obtain the adoption of their
	own plans destroy the labours of their opponents;
	fierce struggles ensue, and here it is the strongest who
	becomes the architect-general.</p>

	<p>The <em lang="la" xml:lang="la">Formica fusca</em> constructs its nest of plastered
	earth. The different superimposed storeys have
	been added one by one to the upper part of the old
	dwelling when the latter became too small for the
	<a class="pagenum" id="page218" title="218"> </a>growing colony. In opening an ant-hill, they are
	found to be quite distinct from each other; each is
	divided by a large number of partitions into vaulted
	compartments. In the larger ones pillars of earth
	support the ceiling. The rooms communicate with
	one another by means of bull’s-eye passages formed
	in the separating walls. The whole is small, proportioned
	to the size of the works, but excellently
	arranged.</p>

	<p>When, in the council of the republic, it has been
	resolved to raise a common habitation, the workers
	operate in a singular manner. All the ants scatter
	themselves abroad, and with extreme activity take
	fragments of earth between their mandibles and place
	them on the summit of the dwelling. After some
	time the result of this microscopical work appears.
	The ancient roof, strengthened by all this material,
	becomes a thick terrace which the insects first cover
	very evenly. The earth, having been brought in grain
	by grain, is soft and easy to dig. The construction of
	the new storey begins at first by the hollowing out
	of a number of trenches. The ants scrape away in
	places the terrace which they have just made. They
	thus diminish the thickness of the layer at the spots
	where rooms, corridors, etc., are to be formed, and
	with the material thus obtained they form walls,
	partitions, and pillars. Soon the entire plan of the
	new storey may be perceived. It differs essentially
	from that which Man would adopt; in the latter case
	the walls would be shown by the hollowing out of the
	foundations; the work of these Hymenoptera, on the
	contrary, shows them in relief. These first arrangements
	made, the six-footed architects have only to
	complete their constructions by new deposits from
	<a class="pagenum" id="page219" title="219"> </a>without. Gradually the storey reaches a sufficient
	height. It remains to cover it, and this is not the
	easiest part of the business. The ceiling is formed
	of vaults going from one wall to another, or from a
	wall to a column. When one of these vaults is to be
	small, some millimetres at the most, the <em lang="la" xml:lang="la">Formica fusca</em>
	constructs it with the help of two ledges, which are
	made facing each other on the tops of two partitions.
	These prominences, formed of materials glued together
	by saliva, are enlarged by additions to their
	free edges. They advance to meet each other and
	soon join; it is wonderful to see each insect, following
	its individual initiative, profit by every twig or
	fragment capable of bearing any weight, in order to
	enlarge the overhanging ledges.</p>

	<p><em id="ch_6_21" class="section_title">Individual skill and reflection.</em> — This personality in
	work, which reveals the intelligent effort of each, has
	certainly its inconveniences for the common work.
	Badly-concerted operations may not succeed, and
	Huber witnessed an accident due to this cause.<a href="#footnote_105" id="fnm105"  class="fnmarker">105</a> Two
	walls facing each other were to be united by an arch.
	A foolish worker had begun to form a horizontal
	ledge on the summit of one of the walls without
	paying attention to the fact that the other wall was
	very much higher. By continuing the project the
	ceiling would have come against the middle of the
	opposite ceiling instead of resting on its summit.
	Another ant passes, examines affairs with an intelligent
	air, and evidently considers that this sort of
	work is absurd. Without consideration for the
	<em lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">amour-propre</em> of its unskilful fellow-citizen, it demolishes
	its work, raises the wall that is too low, and
	re-makes the construction correctly in the presence
	<a class="pagenum" id="page220" title="220"> </a>of the observer. If this incident reveals inconceivable
	thoughtlessness in one of the members of this serious
	republic, it also brings to light the judgment, reflection,
	and decision of which they are capable, as well
	as a freedom which cannot be found in the works of
	instinct.</p>

	<p>This <em lang="la" xml:lang="la">Formica fusca</em> sometimes finds itself in the
	presence of other difficulties. It may happen that
	the hall to be roofed is too large and the arch too
	considerable to allow of the cohesion of the materials
	employed. The insects soon become aware of the
	existence of this embarrassing state of things and
	remedy it in various ways, either by hastily constructing
	pillars in the centre of the too large room,
	or by some other method. Ebrard describes an
	artifice he has seen employed, which shows to what
	an extent ants can quickly appreciate and take
	advantage of the most unforeseen circumstances.<a href="#footnote_106" id="fnm106"  class="fnmarker">106</a>
	A worker was labouring to cover a large cell; two
	prominences, parts of opposite walls, were advancing
	towards each other, but there was still a space of
	from twelve to fifteen millimetres between them, and
	it seemed no longer possible to burden the two sides
	without risking a general downfall. The little mason
	was much disturbed. A graminaceous plant was growing
	near. The ant seemed anxious to take advantage
	of it, for it went to it and climbed up the stalk. After
	having examined and devised, it set about curving
	it in the direction of the edifice. To attain this
	object, it placed a little mass of moist earth on the
	extremity of the leaf, and fixed it there. Under the
	influence of this weight flexion was produced, but
	only at the end. This could not satisfy the insect;
	<a class="pagenum" id="page221" title="221"> </a>it became a question of decreasing the resistance at
	the base. The ant gnawed a little at this spot; the
	desired result was attained, and the whole length of
	the leaf became bent over the building in course of
	construction. To prevent it bending back, and to
	ensure its remaining adherent to the roof, the worker
	returned to the plant and placed earth between the
	sheath and the stalk. This time all difficulties were
	surmounted, and there was a solid scaffolding to
	support the materials for the roof.</p>

	<p>Among the <em lang="la" xml:lang="la">Lasius niger</em> the independence of the
	workers is perhaps still greater; no doubt they do
	their best to concert their efforts, but they do not
	succeed so well as if an inevitable instinct impelled
	them. Notwithstanding the irregularities of the construction,
	it is possible to recognise in it a whole
	formed of hollowed, concentric half-spheres; they
	have been added one after the other to the surface to
	increase the dwelling. The interval between these
	clay spheres constitutes a storey, cut up by the partitions
	which divide it into chambers and communicating
	galleries; the roofs of the largest halls are
	supported by numerous pillars. (<a href="#fig40" id="fig40mark">Fig. 40.</a>)</p>

	<p>These ants, as Huber has shown, are highly
	accomplished in the art of constructing a cupola.
	When they wish to increase their nest by a new
	layer, they take advantage of the first wet day, the
	rain serving to agglutinate and unite the materials.
	They operate in almost the same way as the <em lang="la" xml:lang="la">Formica
	fusca</em>, though exhibiting more skill and resource as
	architects; they know better how to calculate beforehand
	the number of pillars required in a hall of a
	determined size. As soon as the rain has given the
	signal for work, they spread themselves abroad and
	<a class="pagenum" id="page222" title="222"> </a>prepare a very thick terrace on the external surface
	of the dwelling which has become too small. They
	carry to it small balls of earth ground very fine by
	their jaws, and then lightly piled up so as to pulverise
	afresh; these are then spread over the construction
	with the anterior
	legs. Then, by
	hollowing out,
	the ants trace

	<p>The vaulting is
	executed by the
	method already
	described; horizontal ledges, slanting from the summit
	of pillar or wall, are formed to meet one another. The
	insects are intelligent enough to begin their labour at
	the spots best fitted to give strong support to the overhanging
	materials, as for instance, at the angle of two
	walls. There is so much activity among the workers,
	<a class="pagenum" id="page223" title="223"> </a>and they are so anxious to take advantage of the
	damp, that the storey is sometimes completely
	finished in seven or eight hours. If the rain suddenly
	stops in the course of the work, they abandon operations,
	to complete them as soon as another shower falls.</p>

	<p>I have already had occasion to speak of the covered
	passages and Aphis-pens built by Ants outside their
	dwellings. Besides these constructions, they also
	make roads in the fields, tearing up the grass and
	hollowing out the earth so as to form a beaten path
	free from the lilliputian bushes in which there would
	be danger of becoming entangled, on returning to the
	nest laden with various and often embarrassing burdens.</p>

	<p>Nor are Ants by any means alone in exhibiting
	the results of individual skill and reflection. It will,
	however, be sufficient to mention only one other
	example, that furnished by Spiders. McCook, in his
	great work, after elaborately describing and carefully
	illustrating the skill exhibited in individual cases by
	Spiders in their aërial labours, considers himself
	justified in concluding as follows: — “The manner in
	which the ends of the radii which terminate upon the
	herb are wrapped roundabout and braced by the
	notched zone; the manner in which the wide non-viscid
	scaffold lines are woven in order to give
	vantage ground from which to place the close-lying
	and permanent viscid spirals, upon which the usefulness
	of the orb depends — all these, to mention no
	other points, seem to indicate a very delicate perception
	of those modes (shall I also say principles?)
	of construction which are continually recognised
	in the art of the builder, the architect, and the
	engineer.”<a href="#footnote_107" id="fnm107"  class="fnmarker">107</a></p>

	<p><a class="pagenum" id="page224" title="224"> </a><em id="ch_6_22" class="section_title">Dwellings built of hard materials united by mortar.</em> — Among
	mammals few animals have become so
	skilful in the art of building houses as the insects
	we have just been considering. There are, however,
	two who equal if they do not surpass them — the
	Musk-rat and its relative, the Beaver.</p>

	<p>The Musk-rats of Canada live in colonies on the
	banks of streams or deep lakes, and construct dwellings
	which are very well arranged. In their methods
	we find combined the woven shelter with the house of
	built earth. Their cabins are established over the
	highest level of the water and look like little domes.
	In building them the animals begin by placing reeds
	in the earth; these they interlace and weave so as to
	form a sort of vertical mat. They plaster it externally
	with a layer of mud, which is mixed by means of the
	paws and smoothed by the tail. At the upper part of
	the hut the reeds are not pressed together or covered
	with earth, so that the air may be renewed in the interior.
	A dwelling of this kind, intended to house six
	or eight individuals who have combined to build it,
	may measure up to 65 centimetres in diameter. There
	is no door directly opening on to the ground. A subterranean
	gallery starts from the floor and opens out
	beneath the water. It presents secondary branches,
	some horizontal, through which the animal goes in
	search of roots for food, while others descend vertically
	to pits specially reserved for the disposal of
	ordure.</p>

	<p>But it is, above all, the Beaver (<em lang="la" xml:lang="la">Castor fiber</em>) who
	exhibits the highest qualities as an engineer and
	mason. This industrious and sagacious Rodent is well
	adapted to inconvenience the partisans of instinct as
	an entity, apart from intelligence, which renders
	<a class="pagenum" id="page225" title="225"> </a>animals similar to machines and impels them to
	effect associated acts, without themselves being able
	to understand them, and with a fatality and determination
	from which they can under no circumstance
	escape.</p>

	<p>Beavers now only live in Canada. A few individuals
	may, however, still be found on the banks of
	the lower Rhône, in Camargue, and on a few other
	European rivers. Several centuries ago they existed
	in the neighbourhood of Paris in considerable numbers.
	The Bièvre gained its name from the old French word
	for Beaver, and its resemblance to the English name,
	as well as to the German (<em lang="la" xml:lang="la">Biber</em>), is striking. In the
	sixteenth century, according to Bishop Magnus of
	Upsala, the Beaver was still common on the banks
	of the Rhine, the Danube, and on the shores of the
	Black Sea, and in the North it still exercised great
	art in its constructions. In the twelfth century it
	was found in Scotland and Wales. If we go back to
	ancient times, we find that Herodotus mentions that
	the Budini who lived in the neighbourhood of the Black
	Sea used the skins of the Beavers, which abounded
	there, on the borders of their garments; and in the
	time of Pliny the Beaver was so common there that
	he speaks of it as the Pontic Beaver. Fossil remains
	of the Beaver have also been found throughout
	Europe in conjunction with those of the Mammoth
	and other extinct animals.</p>

	<p>But the civilisation of the Beaver has perished in
	the presence of Man’s civilisation, or rather of his
	persecution. In regions where it is tracked and
	disturbed by Man the Beaver lives in couples, and is
	content to hollow out a burrow like the Otter’s, instead
	of showing its consummate art. It merely vegetates,
	<a class="pagenum" id="page226" title="226"> </a>fleeing from enemies who are too strong for it, and
	depriving itself of a dangerous comfort. But when
	the security of solitude permits these animals to
	unite in societies, and to possess, without too much
	fear, a pond or a stream, they then exhibit all their
	industry.</p>

	<p>They build very well arranged dwellings, although
	at first sight they look like mere piles of twigs,
	branches, and logs, heaped in disorder on a small
	dome of mud. At the edge of a pond each raises
	his own lodge, and there is no work by the colony in
	common. If, however, there is a question of inhabiting
	the bank of a shallow stream, certain preliminary
	works become necessary. The rodents establish a
	dam, so that they may possess a large sheet of water
	which may be of fair depth, and above all constant,
	not at the mercy of the rise and fall of the stream. A
	sudden and excessive flood is the one danger likely to
	prove fatal to these dykes; but even our own constructions
	are threatened under such circumstances.</p>

	<p>When the Beavers, tempted by abundance of
	willows and poplars, of which they eat the bark and
	utilise the wood in construction, have chosen a site,
	and have decided to establish a village on the edge of
	the water, there are several labours to be successively
	accomplished. Their first desire is to be in possession
	of a large number of felled trunks of trees. To
	obtain them they scatter themselves in the forest
	bordering the stream and attack saplings of from
	twenty to thirty centimetres in diameter. They are
	equipped for this purpose. With their powerful
	incisors, worked by strong jaws, they can soon gnaw
	through a tree of this size. But they are capable of
	attacking trees, even more than 100 cc. in circumference
	<a class="pagenum" id="page227" title="227"> </a>and some forty metres in height, with great
	skill and adaptability; “no better work could be accomplished
	by a most highly-finished steel cutting tool,
	wielded by a muscular human arm” (Martin). They
	operate seated on their hind quarters, and they make
	their incision in the wood with a feather edge. It
	was once supposed that they always take care so to
	direct their wood-cutting task that the tree may fall
	on the water-side, but this is by no means the case,
	and appears to be simply due, as Martin points out,
	to the fact that trees by the water-side usually slope
	towards the water. The austerity of labour alternates,
	it may be added, with the pleasures of the table.
	From time to time the Beavers remove the bark of the
	fallen trees, of which they are very fond, and feed on it.</p>

	<p>Mr. Lewis H. Morgan studied the American Beaver
	with great care and thoroughness, more especially on
	the south-west shore of Lake Superior; he devotes
	fifty pages to the dams, and it is worth while to quote
	his preliminary remarks regarding them. “The dam
	is the principal structure of the beaver. It is also the
	most important of his erections as it is the most
	extensive, and because its production and preservation
	could only be accomplished by patient and long-continued
	labour. In point of time, also, it precedes the
	lodge, since the floor of the latter and the entrances
	to its chamber are constructed with reference to the
	level of the water in the pond. The object of the
	dam is the formation of an artificial pond, the principal
	use of which is the refuge it affords to them when
	assailed, and the water-connection it gives to their
	lodges and to their burrows in the banks. Hence, as
	the level of the pond must, in all cases, rise from one
	to two feet above these entrances for the protection of
	<a class="pagenum" id="page228" title="228"> </a>the animal from pursuit and capture, the surface-level
	of the pond must, to a greater or less extent, be
	subject to their immediate control. As the dam is
	not an absolute necessity to the beaver for the maintenance
	of his life, his normal habitation being rather
	natural ponds and rivers, and burrows in their banks,
	it is, in itself considered, a remarkable fact that he
	should have voluntarily transferred himself, by means
	of dams and ponds of his own construction, from a
	natural to an artificial mode of life.</p>

	<p>“Some of these dams are so extensive as to forbid
	the supposition that they were the exclusive work of
	a single pair, or of a single family of beavers; but it
	does not follow, as has very generally been supposed,
	that several families, or a colony, unite for the joint
	construction of a dam. After careful examination of
	some hundreds of these structures, and of the lodges
	and burrows attached to many of them, I am altogether
	satisfied that the larger dams were not the
	joint-product of the labour of large numbers of
	beavers working together, and brought thus to immediate
	completion; but, on the contrary, that they
	arose from small beginnings, and were built upon
	year after year, until they finally reached that size
	which exhausted the capabilities of the location;
	after which they were maintained for centuries, at
	the ascertained standard, by constant repairs. So far
	as my observations have enabled me to form an
	opinion, I think they were usually, if not invariably,
	commenced by a single pair, or a single family of
	beavers; and that when, in the course of time, by
	the gradual increase of the dam, the pond had
	become sufficiently enlarged to accommodate more
	families than one, other families took up their residence
	<a class="pagenum" id="page229" title="229"> </a>upon it, and afterwards contributed by their
	labour to its maintenance. There is no satisfactory
	evidence that the American beavers either live or
	work in colonies; and if some such cases have been
	observed, it will either be found to be an exception
	to the general rule, or in consequence of the sudden
	destruction of a work upon the maintenance of which
	a number of families were at the time depending.</p>

	<p>“The great age of the larger dams is shown by their
	size, by the large amount of solid materials they
	contain, and by the destruction of the primitive forest
	within the area of the ponds; and also by the extent
	of the beaver-meadows along the margins of the
	streams where dams are maintained, and by the
	hummocks formed upon them by and through the
	annual growth and decay of vegetation in separate
	hills. These meadows were undoubtedly covered
	with trees adapted to a wet soil when the dams were
	constructed. It must have required long periods of
	time to destroy every vestige of the ancient forest by
	the increased saturation of the earth, accompanied
	with occasional overflows from the streams. The
	evidence from these and other sources tends to show
	that these dams have existed in the same places for
	hundreds and thousands of years, and that they have
	been maintained by a system of continuous repairs.</p>

	<p>“At the place selected for the construction of a dam,
	the ground is usually firm and often stony, and when
	across the channel of a flowing stream, a hard rather
	than a soft bottom is preferred. Such places are
	necessarily unfavourable for the insertion of stakes
	in the ground, if such were, in fact, their practice in
	building dams. The theory upon which beaver-dams
	are constructed is perfectly simple, and involves no
	<a class="pagenum" id="page230" title="230"> </a>such necessity. Soft earth, intermixed with vegetable
	fibre, is used to form an embankment, with sticks,
	brush, and poles embedded within these materials to
	bind them together, and to impart to them the
	requisite solidity to resist the effects both of pressure
	and of saturation. Small sticks and brush are used,
	in the first instance, with mud and earth and stones
	for down-weight. Consequently these dams are extremely
	rude at their commencement, and they do
	not attain their remarkably artistic appearance until
	after they have been raised to a considerable height,
	and have been maintained, by a system of annual
	repairs, for a number of years.”<a href="#footnote_108" id="fnm108"  class="fnmarker">108</a></p>

	<p>There are two different kinds of beaver-dams,
	although they are both constructed on the same
	principle. One, the stick-dam, consists of interlaced
	stick and pole work below, with an embankment of
	earth raised with the same material upon the upper
	or water face. This is usually found in brooks or
	large streams with ill-defined banks. The other, the
	solid-bank dam, is not so common nor so interesting,
	and is usually found on those parts of the same
	stream where the banks are well defined, the
	channel deep, and the current uniform. In this kind
	the earth and mud entirely buries the sticks and
	poles, giving the whole a solid appearance. In the
	first kind the surplus water percolates through the
	dam along its entire length, while in the second it is
	discharged through a single opening in the crest
	formed for that purpose.</p>

	<p>The materials being prepared in the manner I have
	previously described, the animals make ready to
	<a class="pagenum" id="page231" title="231"> </a>establish their dyke. They intermix their materials — driftwood,
	green willows, birch, poplars, etc. — in the
	bed of the river, with mud and stones, so making
	a solid bank, capable of resisting a great force of
	water; sometimes the trees will shoot up forming
	a hedge. The dam has a thickness of from three to
	four metres at the base, and about sixty centimetres
	at the upper part. The wall facing up-stream is
	sloping, that directed down-stream is vertical; this is
	the best arrangement for supporting the pressure of
	the mass of water which is thus expended on an
	inclined surface. In certain cases Beavers carry
	hydraulic science still further. If the course of the
	water is not very rapid, they generally make an
	almost straight dyke, perpendicular to the two banks,
	as this is then sufficient; but if the current is strong,
	they curve it so that the convexity is turned up-stream.
	In this way it is much better fitted to resist.
	Thus they do not always act in the same way, but
	arrange their actions so as to adapt them to the
	conditions of the environment.</p>

	<p>The embankment being completed, the animals
	construct their lodges. Fragments of wood, deprived
	of the bark, are arranged and united by clay or mud
	which the Beavers take from the riverside, transport,
	mix, and work with their fore-paws. During a single
	night they can collect as much mud at their houses as
	amounts to some thousands of their small handfuls.
	They thus plaster their houses with mud every
	autumn; in the winter this freezes as hard as a stone
	and protects them from enemies. These cabins form
	domes from three to four metres in diameter at the
	base, and from two to two and a half metres in
	height. The floor is on a level with the surface of
	<a class="pagenum" id="page232" title="232"> </a>the artificial pond. A passage sinks in the earth and
	opens about one and a half metres below the level of
	the water, so that it cannot be closed up by ice during
	the severe winters of these regions.</p>

	<p>Within, near the entry, the beavers form, with the
	aid of a partition, a special compartment to serve as a
	storehouse, and they there pile up enormous heaps of
	nenuphar roots as provisions for the days when ice and
	snow will prevent them from barking the young trunks.</p>

	<p>A dwelling of this kind may last for three or four
	years, and the animal here tranquilly enjoys the fruits
	of its industry, as long as man fails to discover the
	retreat; for the beaver can escape by swimming from
	all carnivorous animals excepting, perhaps, the Otter.
	During floods the level of the water nearly reaches the
	hut; if the inundation is prolonged and the animal
	runs the risk of being asphyxiated beneath his dome,
	it breaks through the upper part with its teeth and
	escapes. When the water returns to its bed the
	beaver comes back, makes the necessary repairs, and
	resumes the usual peaceful course of its life.<a href="#footnote_109" id="fnm109"  class="fnmarker">109</a></p>

	<p>We have thus seen, from a shapeless hole to these
	complex dwellings, every possible stage; we have
	found among animals the rudiments of the different
	human habitations, certain animals, indeed, having
	arrived at a degree of civilisation which Man himself
	in some countries has not yet surpassed, or even
	indeed yet attained.</p>

	<p><em id="ch_7_1" class="section_title">General precautions against possible danger.</em> — Some
	animals show, even during the construction of the nest,
	extreme prudence in preventing its site from being
	discovered. Several authors refer to the stratagem
	of the Magpie, who begins several nests at the same
	time; but only one is intended to receive the brood,
	and that only is completed. The aim of the others
	is merely to distract attention. It is around these latter
	that the bird shows ostentatious activity, while it
	works at the real nest only for a few hours during
	the day, in the morning and evening.</p>

	<p>The Crane takes equally ingenious precautions in
	order that its constant presence at the same spot
	may not arouse suspicion. It never comes or goes
	<a class="pagenum" id="page234" title="234"> </a>flying, but always on foot, concealing itself along tufts
	of reeds. De Homeyer even reports that the female
	at the time of laying covers her wings and back with
	mud. When dried this gives the animal a red tone,
	which causes it to be confused with neighbouring
	objects; this is intentional mimicry.</p>

	<p>The Linnet (<a href="#fig41" id="fig41mark">Fig. 41</a>) again, wrongly accused of
	wanting judgment, is well aware that a pile of excrement
	at the foot of a tree announces a nest in the
	branches. It is careful to suppress this revealing
	sign, and every day takes it away in its beak to
	disperse it afar.</p>

	<p>Birds will sometimes take the trouble to remove
	the eggs or the nest altogether, when the latter has
	been discovered, in order to avoid further risks of
	danger. The American Sparrow Hawk has been
	observed to do this, and the following incident is
	quoted by Bendire, from MacFarlane’s <cite>Manuscript
	Notes on Birds Nesting in British America</cite>, concerning
	the Pigeon Hawk (<em lang="la" xml:lang="la">Falco columbarius</em>): — “On
	May 25, 1864, a trusty Indian in my employ found
	a nest placed in a thick branch of a pine tree at a
	height of about six feet from the ground. It was
	rather loosely constructed of a few dry sticks and a
	small quantity of coarse hay; it then contained two
	eggs; both parents were seen, fired at, and missed.
	On the 31st he revisited the nest, which still held but
	two eggs, and again missed the birds. Several days
	later he made another visit thereto, and, to his surprise,
	the eggs and parents had disappeared. His
	first impression was that some other person had
	taken them; but after looking carefully around he
	perceived both birds at a short distance, and this led
	him to institute a search which soon resulted in finding
	<a class="pagenum" id="page235" title="235"> </a>that the eggs must have been removed by the
	parent birds to the face of a muddy bank at least
	forty yards distant from the original nest. A few
	decayed leaves had been placed under them, but
	nothing else in the way of lining. A third egg had
	been added in the interim. There can hardly be any
	doubt of the truth of the foregoing facts.”<a href="#footnote_110" id="fnm110"  class="fnmarker">110</a></p>

	<p><a class="pagenum" id="page236" title="236"> </a><em id="ch_7_2" class="section_title">Separation of females while brooding.</em> — The Hornbill
	of Malacca<a href="#footnote_111" id="fnm111"  class="fnmarker">111</a> assures the protection of its nest and of
	the female while she is brooding in a singular manner.
	She lays in the hollow of a tree; as soon as she begins
	to sit on her eggs, the male closes the opening with
	diluted clay, only leaving a hole through which the
	captive can pass her beak to receive the fruits which
	he brings her in abundance. If the lady is thus
	cloistered as closely as in the most jealous harem, her
	lord and master at least expends on her the most
	attentive cares.</p>

	<p>What can be the object of this strange custom?
	It has been asserted that during incubation the female
	loses her feathers and becomes unable to fly. The
	male would thus only wall her up as a precaution for
	fear of seeing her fall from the nest; because if this
	deplorable accident happened she would not be able
	to get back again. It seems to me that the effect is
	here taken for the cause, and that the falling off of
	feathers and torpidity must be the result rather than
	the motive of cloistration. One is tempted to believe
	that the male desires by this method to guarantee his
	female and her offspring against the attacks of squirrels
	or rapacious birds.</p>

	<p><em id="ch_7_3" class="section_title">Hygienic measures of Bees.</em> — Among the animals
	who expend industry on hygiene and the protection
	of their dwellings, we must place Bees in the first line.
	It may happen that mice, snakes, and moths may
	find their way into a hive. Assaulted by the swarm,
	and riddled with stings, they die without being able to
	escape. These great corpses cannot be dragged out
	by the Hymenoptera, and their putrefaction threatens
	<a class="pagenum" id="page237" title="237"> </a>to cause disease. To remedy this scourge the insects
	immediately cover them with <em>propolis</em> — that is to say,
	the paste which they manufacture from the resin of
	poplars, birches, and pines. The corpse thus sheltered
	from contact with the air does not putrefy. In other
	respects Bees are very careful about the cleanliness of
	their dwellings; they remove with care and throw
	outside dust, mud, and sawdust which may be found
	there. Bees are careful also not to defile their hives
	with excrement, as Kirby noted; they go aside to
	expel their excretions, and in winter, when prevented
	by extreme cold or the closing of the hive from going
	out for this purpose, their bodies become so swollen
	from retention of fæces that when at last able to go
	out they fall to the ground and perish. Büchner
	records the observations of a friend of his during a
	season in which a severe epidemic of dysentery had
	broken out among the bees, which interfered with
	the usual habits of the insects; on careful examination
	of a hive it was found that a cavity in the
	posterior wall of the hive, containing crumbled clay,
	had been used as an earth closet. Many mammals
	are equally careful in this respect; thus, for example,
	the Beaver, as Hearne observed, always enters the
	water, or goes out on the ice, to urinate or defæcate;
	the fæces float and are soon disintegrated.</p>

	<p>Animals are also careful about aëration. Thus,
	among Bees, in a hive full of very active insects the
	heat rises considerably and the air is vitiated. A
	service for aëration is organised. Bees ranged in
	files one above the other in the interior agitate their
	wings with a feverish movement; this movement
	causes a current of air which can be felt by holding
	the hand before the opening of the hive. When the
	<a class="pagenum" id="page238" title="238"> </a>workers of the corps are fatigued, comrades who have
	been resting come to take their place. These acts are
	not the result of a stupid instinct which the Hymenoptera
	obey without understanding. If we place a
	swarm, as Huber did, in a roomy position where there
	is plenty of air, they do not devote themselves to an
	aimless exercise. This only takes place in the narrow
	dwellings which Man grants to his winged guests.</p>

	<p>The attention of Ants to public hygiene is more
	than equalled by their attention to personal hygiene.
	Without going into the question of their athletic
	exercises, which have attracted considerable attention,
	it is sufficient to quote one observer as to
	their habits of cleanliness. McCook remarks: — “The
	Agricultural Ants — and the remark applies to all
	other Ants of which I have knowledge — is one of
	the neatest of creatures in her personal habits. I
	think I have never seen one of my imprisoned harvesters,
	either <em lang="la" xml:lang="la">Barbatus</em> or <em lang="la" xml:lang="la">Crudelis</em>, in an untidy
	condition. They issue from their burrows, after the
	most active digging, even when the earth is damp,
	without being perceptibly soiled. Such minute particles
	of dust as cling to the body are carefully
	removed. Indeed, the whole body is frequently and
	thoroughly cleansed, a duty which is habitually, I
	might almost venture to say invariably, attended to
	after eating and after sleep. In this process the Ants
	assist one another; and it is an exceedingly interesting
	sight which is presented to the observer when
	this general ‘washing up’ is in progress.”<a href="#footnote_112" id="fnm112"  class="fnmarker">112</a></p>

	<p><em id="ch_7_4" class="section_title">Prudence of Bees.</em> — Certain species exhibit very
	great prudence, especially the <em lang="la" xml:lang="la">Melipona geniculata</em>,
	<a class="pagenum" id="page239" title="239"> </a>which lives in a wild state in South America. They
	place their combs in the hollow of a tree or the cleft
	of a rock; they fill up all the crevices and only leave
	a round hole for entry. And even this they are
	accustomed to close every evening by a small partition,
	which they remove in the morning. This door
	is shut with various materials, such as resin or even
	clay, which the bees bring on their legs as those of
	our own country bring pollen.</p>

	<p>All these facts were observed with great exactness
	in a swarm given in 1874 by M. Drory (who during a
	long period of years studied every Brazilian species
	of <em lang="la" xml:lang="la">Melipona</em> at Bordeaux) to the Jardin d’Acclimatation.
	It was even seen that the door might be put
	up under certain circumstances in open day, as for
	example, when a storm or sudden cold delays the
	appearance of the workers. If one of them happened
	to be late it had to perforate the partition, and the
	hole was then stopped up again.</p>

	<p><em id="ch_7_5" class="section_title">Fortifications of Bees.</em> — As these facts take place
	always they may be called instinctive; but that is
	not the case with regard to defences elevated with
	a view to a particular circumstance, and which disappear
	when the danger to which they correspond
	disappears. Such are the labours of the bees to
	repel the invasions of the large nocturnal Death’s-head
	Moth. (<a href="#fig42" id="fig42mark">Fig. 42.</a>) He is very greedy of honey,
	and furtively introduces himself into the hives. Protected
	by the long and fluffy hairs which cover him,
	he has little to fear from stings, and gorges himself
	with the greatest freedom on the stores of the swarm.
	Huber, in his admirable investigations,<a href="#footnote_113" id="fnm113"  class="fnmarker">113</a> narrates
	that one year in Switzerland numbers of hives were
	<a class="pagenum" id="page240" title="240"> </a>emptied, and contained no more honey in summer
	than in the spring. During that year Death’s-head
	Moths were very numerous. The illustrious naturalist
	soon became certain that this moth was guilty of the
	thefts in question.</p>
	<div id="fig42" class="figright">
		<img src="images/th_fig_42.png" width="316" height="210" alt="A large dark moth." />
		<p class="caption"><a href="#fig42mark">Fig. 42.</a></p>
	</div>
	<p class="continued_paragraph">While he was reflecting as to
	what should be done, the bees, who were more
	directly interested, had invented several different
	methods of procedure. Some closed the entrance
	<a class="pagenum" id="page241" title="241"> </a>with wax, leaving only a narrow opening through
	which the great robber could not penetrate. Others
	built up before the opening a series of parallel walls,
	leaving between them a zigzag corridor through which
	the Hymenoptera themselves were able to enter.
	But the intruder was much too long to perform this
	exercise successfully. Man utilises defences of this
	kind; it is thus at the entrance of a field, for
	example, he places a turnstile, or parallel bars that
	do not face each other; the passage is not closed for
	him, but a cow is too long to overcome the obstacle.
	In years when the Death’s-head Moth is rare the bees
	do not set up these barricades, which, indeed, they
	themselves find troublesome. For two or three consecutive
	years they leave their doors wide open. Then
	another invasion occurs, and they immediately close the
	openings. It cannot be denied that in these cases their
	acts agree with circumstances that are not habitual.<a href="#footnote_114" id="fnm114"  class="fnmarker">114</a></p>

	<p><em id="ch_7_6" class="section_title">Precautions against inquisitiveness.</em> — I will finally
	quote a fact of defence which took place under circumstances
	that were absolutely exceptional, and which
	therefore exhibits genuine reflection in these insects.
	During the first exhibition of 1855 an artificial hive
	was set up, one face of which was closed by a glass
	pane. A wooden shutter concealed this pane, but
	passers-by opened it every moment to contemplate
	the work of the small insects. Annoyed by this
	inquisitiveness, the bees resolved to put an end to it,
	and cemented the shutter with <em>propolis</em>. When this
	substance dried it was no longer possible to open the
	shutter. The bees were visible to nobody.</p>

	<p><em id="ch_7_8" class="section_title">Lighting up the nests.</em> — An improvement of another
	<a class="pagenum" id="page242" title="242"> </a>nature in the comfort of the dwelling is introduced by
	the <em lang="la" xml:lang="la">Baya</em>, and if the facts narrated are correct they are
	the most marvellous of all. It is a question of lighting
	up a nest by means of Glow-worms. The <em lang="la" xml:lang="la">Melicourvis
	baya</em> inhabits India; it is a small bird related to the
	<em lang="la" xml:lang="la">Loxia</em>, already spoken of in this book. Like the
	latter it constructs a nest that is very well designed
	and executed. (<a href="#fig43" id="fig43mark">Fig. 43.</a>) It suspends it in general
	from a palm tree, but sometimes also from the roofs
	of houses. In these shelters, woven with extreme art,
	are always to be found little balls of dry and hardened
	clay. Why does the bird amass these objects? Is
	it impelled by a collector’s instinct less perfect than
	that of the Bower-bird? There is no reason to
	suppose this. Nor does it appear that he wishes to
	make the nest heavier and prevent it by this ballast
	from being blown about by every breeze when the
	couple are out, and the young not heavy enough to
	ensure the stability of the edifice. The part played
	by these little balls is much more remarkable, if we
	may trust the evidence of the natives, as confirmed
	by competent European observers. Thus Mr. H. A. Severn
	writes: — “I have been informed on safe
	authority that the Indian Bottle-bird protects his
	nest at night by sticking several of these glow-beetles
	around the entrance by means of clay; and only a
	few days back an intimate friend of my own was
	watching three rats on a roof-rafter of his bungalow
	when a glow-fly lodged very close to them; the rats
	immediately scampered off.”<a href="#footnote_115" id="fnm115"  class="fnmarker">115</a> These observations are
	confirmed by Captain Briant, as reported by Professor
	R. Dubois.<a href="#footnote_116" id="fnm116"  class="fnmarker">116</a></p>

	CONCLUSION.</h2>

	<p class="chapter_contents">DEGREE OF PERFECTION IN INDUSTRY INDEPENDENT OF
    ZOOLOGICAL SUPERIORITY — MENTAL FACULTIES OF THE
    LOWER ANIMALS OF LIKE NATURE TO MAN’S.</p>

	<p><em id="ch_8_1" class="section_title">Degree of perfection in industry independent of
	zoological superiority.</em> — As the result of our study we
	see the fundamental industries of Man dispersed
	throughout the animal kingdom, though not, indeed,
	all of them, nor the more subtle, which were only
	born yesterday. We may remark the extent to which
	intellectual manifestations of this sort are independent
	of the more or less elevated rank assigned to
	species in zoological classification. The latter, as it
	should be, brings together or separates beings according
	to their physical character. But intelligence does
	not depend on the whole body; its superior or inferior
	development is related to a certain corresponding
	complexity in the surface, volume, and histologic
	structure of the nervous centres.</p>

	<p>It happens with the cerebral as with the other
	functions. An animal’s superiority is not exhibited
	in all his organs nor in all his qualities; it results from
	<a class="pagenum" id="page247" title="247"> </a>a certain grouping of characters in which there may
	be weak points. The highest in organisation are not
	necessarily the swiftest or the strongest, any more
	than they are necessarily the most intelligent. It
	may happen; it happens in the case of Man; but it
	as easily fails to happen. In organisation the Horse
	is nearer to Man than the Ant; but it is far otherwise
	as regards intellectual development.</p>

	<p>For this reason, when following the progress of any
	industry, I have taken my examples first in one group,
	then in another far-removed group, to return afterwards
	to the first. There are not, and cannot be,
	bonds between a solitary function of the being and
	its place in classification — a place which has been
	determined by the form of all the organs, without
	even taking into account their methods of activity.</p>

	<p>Comparative anatomy has long since removed the
	barriers, once thought impassable, raised by human
	pride between Man and the other animals. Our
	bodies do not differ from theirs; and moreover, such
	glimpses as we are able to obtain allow us to conclude
	that their psychic faculties are of the same
	nature as our own. Man in his evolution introduces
	no new factor.</p>

	<p>The industries in which the talents of animals are
	exercised demonstrate that, under the influence of the
	same environment, animals have reacted in the same
	manner as Man, and have formed the same combinations
	to protect themselves from cold or heat, to
	defend themselves against the attacks of enemies,
	and to ensure sufficient provision of food during
	those hard seasons of the year when the earth does
	not yield in abundance.</p>

	<p>It must only be added, to avoid falling into
	<a class="pagenum" id="page248" title="248"> </a>exaggeration, that Man excels in all the arts, of
	which only scattered rudiments are found among
	the other animals; and we may safeguard our pride
	by affirming that we need not fear comparison. If
	our intelligence is not essentially different from that
	of animals, we have the satisfaction of knowing that
	it is much superior to theirs.</p>

		<li id="footnote_65"><p>There is little doubt, however, that some species of Aphides and allied Coccidæ would be liable to extermination if not protected by their ant masters. See, for instance, Forel, <cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Bull. Soc. Vaud.</cite>, 1876. Mr. Cockerell in Jamaica has noted an interesting Coccid, <em lang="la" xml:lang="la">Icerya rosæ</em>, which is protected by ants; “at the present moment some of these <em lang="la" xml:lang="la">Iceryæ</em> are enjoying life, which would certainly have perished at my hands but for the inconvenience presented by the numbers of stinging ants.” — <cite>Nature</cite>, 27th April 1893. Mr. Romanes (<cite>Nature</cite>, 18th May 1893) quotes as follows from a letter addressed to him by the Rev. W. G. Proudfoot: — “On looking up I noticed that hundreds of large black ants were going up and down the tree, and then I saw the aphides…. But what struck me most was that the aphides showered down their excretions independently of the ants’ solicitations, while at other times I noticed that an ant would approach an aphis without getting anything, and would then go to another. I was struck with this, because I remembered Mr. Darwin’s inability to make the aphides yield their secretion after many experiments. A large number of hornets were flying about the tree, but seemed afraid of the ants; for when they attempted to alight, an ant would at once rush to the spot, and the hornet would get out of its way.”	<a href="#fnm65" title="Return to marker" class="returnFN">Return</a></p></li>

	<h2 class="part_title">APPENDIX.</h2>
	<h3 class="part_section">BIBLIOGRAPHY.</h3>
	<p><cite>Brehm’s Thierleben</cite> is the great repository of facts concerning
	the social lives of the higher animals. The third
	edition, in ten large volumes, fully illustrated, and edited
	by Pechuel Lösche, has lately appeared (Leipzig und Wien,
	Bibliog. Institute, 1890-92). It is, indeed, as Virchow has
	lately termed it, “a sort of zoological library,” popular in
	character, and almost purely descriptive. (There is a
	French edition of this work in nine volumes, but, with
	the exception of one fragment, it has not appeared in
	English. The nearest approach to Brehm’s work in
	England is Cassell’s <cite>New Natural History</cite>, and in
	America the <cite>Riverside Natural History</cite>.) It is impossible
	to enumerate the numberless works by travellers and
	others on which the knowledge of animal industries is
	founded. The works of Huber, Fabre, Audubon, Le
	Vaillant, C. St. John, Belt, Bates, Tennent, are frequently
	quoted in the course of this work. Many of the most
	important and detailed studies of animal industries are
	scattered through the pages of the scientific periodicals
	of all countries. References to a few of the chief of these
	studies will be found in the text.</p>

	<p>For a scientific discussion of the phenomena of animal skill
	and intelligence we may perhaps best turn to Professor
	C. Lloyd Morgan, whose work is always both acute and
	cautious. In <cite>Animal Life and Intelligence</cite> (1890) he has
	<a class="pagenum" id="page250" title="250"> </a>furnished an excellent introduction to the subject. In his
	<cite>Introduction to Comparative Psychology</cite> (shortly to appear
	in the Contemporary Science Series) he discusses the
	fundamental problems of mental processes in animals, and
	the transition from animal intelligence to human intelligence.
	Romanes’ <cite>Mental Evolution in Animals</cite> (1883) and
	other works by this writer, dealing with the same subject,
	but proceeding on a different method, should also be
	studied; and his <cite>Animal Intelligence</cite> (International Science
	Series) is an excellent critical summary of the facts.
	Büchner’s <cite lang="de" xml:lang="de">Aus dem Geistesleben der Thiere</cite> (Berlin, 1877)
	and Houzeau’s <cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Facultés Mentales des Animaux</cite> (Brussels,
	1877) may also be mentioned, and Espinas’ <cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Sociétés
	Animales</cite> (1877), though dealing primarily with sociology,
	is an original and suggestive study of great value.</p>

	<p>As a general introduction, of a popular but not unscientific
	character, to all the various aspects of animal life,
	J. Arthur Thomson’s little book, <cite>The Study of Animal Life</cite>
	(University Extension Manuals, 1892), may be recommended.
	At the end of Mr. Thomson’s volume will be
	found a useful classified list of the “Best Books” on animal
	life.</p>

	<h3 class="part_section">Gardening Ants.</h3>

	<p>The operations of various species of Gardening Ants
	have recently been very thoroughly investigated at Blumenau
	by Herr Alfred Möller, nephew of Dr. Fritz Müller
	(“Die Pilzgärten einiger südamerikanischer Ameisen.”
	Heft 6 of Schimper’s “Botanische Mittheilungen aus den
	Tropen.” Jena: G. Fischer, 1893. Herr Möller’s work is
	clearly summarised by Mr. John C. Willis in “The Fungus
	Gardens of certain South American Ants,” <cite>Nature</cite>, 24th
	August 1893).</p>

	<p>The ants of Blumenau chiefly differ from those described
	by Belt in that they form very narrow streets, in which
	they travel only in single file, and also that their nests
	<a class="pagenum" id="page251" title="251"> </a>occur both in the forest and in the open. The commonest
	species is the <em lang="la" xml:lang="la">Atta</em> (<em lang="la" xml:lang="la">Acromyrmex</em>) <em lang="la" xml:lang="la">discigera</em>, Mayr, and the
	workers are never more than 6.5 mm. long. There are
	other species of <em lang="la" xml:lang="la">Atta</em> which have very similar streets;
	one, the <em lang="la" xml:lang="la">Atta hystrix</em>, Latr., appears to work only at night.
	A minute description is given of a street of <em lang="la" xml:lang="la">A. discigera</em>,
	which was 26 metres long and about 1.5 cm. wide and
	high, roofed in in parts wherever possible. It led to a
	number of small Cupheas, whose leaves the ants were
	cutting. In the street could be seen a procession of
	loaded ants going towards the nest, and others empty-handed,
	going in the opposite direction. Some of the
	large workers run up and down the road unloaded, and
	act as road-menders if any accident happens to a part of
	the track. Other very small workers, which do not cut
	leaves, may also be seen carried upon the backs or even
	upon the loads of the actual leaf-cutters. An ant carrying
	a peculiarly shaped piece of leaf was watched from end to
	end of the track, and travelled the 26 m. in 70 minutes.
	The load was twice as heavy as itself.</p>

	<p>The plants attacked by the ants were found to be very
	numerous, and the ants seemed to be very capricious in
	this respect, one day stripping a plant and the next day
	leaving it untouched.</p>

	<p>The jaws of the ants are very strong, with serrated edges,
	and clash together laterally. The ant begins at the edge of
	a leaf, and cuts out a piece in about five minutes, revolving
	on one of its hind legs as a centre. When the piece is
	almost freed, the ant goes on to the main portion of the
	leaf, cuts through the last piece uniting it with the severed
	portion, drags up the latter, balances it on edge between its
	forelegs, and then, grasping it with its jaws, lifts it up above
	its head, so that the centre of gravity of the load is above the
	ant itself. It then marches off, down the stem, to the base,
	over the ground to the end of the street, and along this to
	the nest, travelling at a very uniform speed, and never
	<a class="pagenum" id="page252" title="252"> </a>letting go its load. The weight thus carried was found, on
	an average, to be twice that of the ant; but many were
	found carrying heavier loads, even as much as ten times
	their own weight!</p>

	<p>The nests are usually below the surface of the soil, but
	covered, wherever necessary, with a thick mass of withered
	pieces of leaves and twigs, etc. They may be as much as
	1-1/2 metres in diameter. In the nests of all species examined
	there is found, filling up the interior, a curious grey spongy
	mass, full of chambers, like a coarse sponge, in which the
	ants may be seen running about, and in which, here and
	there, occur eggs, larvæ, and pupæ. This is the fungus
	garden. It is separated from the roof and lateral walls of
	the nest by a clear space. The walls and roof are much
	thicker in winter than in summer; one nest examined had
	a roof 25 cm. thick and wall 40 cm. The garden consists
	of two parts, differently coloured, but not very sharply
	marked off from each other. The older part is yellowish-red
	in colour; the newly-built portions, forming the surface
	of the garden, are of a blue-black colour. It is this part
	which is of the greater importance to the ants.</p>

	<p>The garden is found, on examination, to consist of an
	immense conglomeration of small round particles of not
	more than .5 mm. in diameter, of a dark green colour when
	quite fresh, then blue-black, and finally yellowish-red.
	They are penetrated by, and enveloped in, white fungus
	hyphæ, which hold the particles together. These hyphæ
	are similar throughout the nest.</p>

	<p>Strewn thickly upon the surface of the garden are seen
	round white bodies about .25 mm. in diameter; they
	always occur in the nests, except in the very young portion
	of the gardens. They consist of aggregations of peculiar
	swollen hyphæ, and are termed by Möller the “Kohl-rabi
	clumps.” The hyphæ swell out at the ends into large
	spherical thickenings, filled with richly vacuolated protoplasm
	like the ordinary hyphæ. These clumps of “Kohl-rabi”
	<a class="pagenum" id="page253" title="253"> </a>are only found on the surface of the garden, and
	form the principal food of the ants; they have no doubt
	reached their present form under the cultivation and selection
	of the ants. The fungus was found to belong to the
	genus <em lang="la" xml:lang="la">Rozites</em>, and the species was named <em lang="la" xml:lang="la">R. gongylophora</em>.
	A microscopic examination of the particles of which the
	garden is composed shows that they contain remains of
	leaves; bits of epidermis, stomata, spiral vessels, etc., occur
	in them.</p>

	<p>If a nest is broken into and the fungus garden scattered,
	the ants collect it as quickly as possible, especially the
	younger parts, taking as much trouble over it as over the
	larvæ. They also cover it up again as soon as possible to
	protect it from the light. A nest, 1 metre × 50 cm., was
	opened, and in twenty-four hours the ants had put on a
	new roof 10 cm. deep.</p>

	<p>Some ants’ nests were placed under a bell jar and
	supplied with leaves; they made no use of them and
	presently died. If they were supplied with a piece of
	“garden,” they rebuilt it and covered it so far as they
	could. It was seen to shrink from day to day, the ants
	bringing out the old pieces and adding them to the wall;
	finally it was exhausted and the ants died. Others were
	starved for five days, and then supplied with a bit of
	garden; they at once began to eat the Kohl-rabi clumps.
	Finally, by supplying the ants with bits of garden, a damp
	sandy floor, and fresh leaves, they were induced to build in
	captivity. The dish in which they worked was covered by
	a glass lid, and when this was covered with a dark cloth
	or otherwise kept dark, the ants built under it without
	covering the garden. In this way the whole process was
	observed. An ant bringing in a piece of leaf proceeds to
	cut it into halves, repeating the process till it has got a
	very small piece left, which it holds between its fore feet
	and turns round, crushing it in its jaws until the whole is
	reduced to a round ball of pulp about .25 mm. thick.
	<a class="pagenum" id="page254" title="254"> </a>This it then takes and adds to the garden. So well is the
	kneading performed that no single cell remains uninjured,
	and it was observed that the hyphæ of the fungus grew
	through and round one of these particles within a few
	hours. Belt supposed that this process was performed
	by the small workers above-mentioned, but it is not so, as
	we have just seen. The small workers perform the function
	of weeding the garden, and this is so well done that a
	portion of it removed and grown in a nutrient solution
	gives a perfectly pure culture, not even containing bacteria!</p>

	<p>In the course of these investigations it was found that
	somewhat similar fungus gardens occur in the nests of the
	hairy ant, <em lang="la" xml:lang="la">Apterostigma</em>, but the fungus appeared to belong
	to a different genus, and the hairy ants, who live in decaying
	wood and have small gardens built of bits of wood-fibre,
	beetle-dung, etc., have not succeeded in cultivating and
	selecting Kohl-rabi to the same high degree. An allied
	genus of ants, <em lang="la" xml:lang="la">Cyphomyrmex</em>, were also found to be fungus-growers.</p>

	<p>This elaborate study, which is illustrated by beautiful
	plates and photographs of the mushroom gardens, constitutes,
	as Mr. Willis (whose summary has here been followed)
	remarks, one of the most fascinating contributions to our
	knowledge of mycology and of animal industries which
	have been made for many years.</p>

		<p class="ad_p_1">By HENRIK IBSEN.</p>
		<p class="ad_p_3">TRANSLATED BY</p>
		<p>WILLIAM AND CHARLES ARCHER.</p>
		<p class="ad_p_2">This Translation, though unrhymed, preserves throughout the
		various rhythms of the original.</p>
		<p class="ad_p_4">“In <cite>Brand</cite> the hero is an embodied protest against the poverty of
		spirit and half-heartedness that Ibsen rebelled against in his countrymen.
		In <cite>Peer Gynt</cite> the hero is himself the embodiment of that spirit.
		In <cite>Brand</cite> the fundamental antithesis, upon which, as its central theme,
		the drama is constructed, is the contrast between the spirit of compromise
		on the one hand, and the motto ‘everything or nothing’ on
		the other. And <cite>Peer Gynt</cite> is the very incarnation of a compromising
		dread of decisive committal to any one course. In <cite>Brand</cite> the problem
		of self-realisation and the relation of the individual to his surroundings
		is obscurely struggling for recognition, and in <cite>Peer Gynt</cite> it becomes the
		formal theme upon which all the fantastic variations of the drama are
		built up. In both plays alike the problems of heredity and the influence
		of early surroundings are more than touched upon; and both alike
		culminate in the doctrine that the only redeeming power on earth or in
		heaven is the power of love.”—Mr. <span class="name">P. H. Wicksteed</span>.</p>

			</li>
			<li>LIFE OF SCHOPENHAUER. By <span class="name">Professor Wallace</span>.
				<p>“We can speak very highly of this little book of Mr. Wallace’s. It

			Set of Five Vols., in Case, 17/6; in Half Morocco, in Case, 32/6.</p>
		<p class="ad_p_7">“We seem at last to be shown men and women as they are; and at first it
		is more than we can endure…. All Ibsen’s characters speak and act as if
		they were hypnotised, and under their creators imperious demand to reveal
		themselves. There never was such a mirror held up to nature before: it is
		too terrible…. Yet we must return to Ibsen, with his remorseless surgery,
		his remorseless electric-light, until we, too, have grown strong and learned to
		face the naked—if necessary, the flayed and bleeding—reality.”—<cite>Speaker</cite>
		<em>(London)</em>.</p>

			<li>Vol. I. “A DOLL’S HOUSE,” “THE LEAGUE OF YOUTH,” and “THE PILLARS OF SOCIETY.” With Portrait of the Author, and Biographical Introduction by <span class="name">William Archer</span>.</li>

		</ul>
		<p class="ad_p_4">The sequence of the plays <em>in each volume</em> is chronological; the complete
		set of volumes comprising the dramas thus presents them in chronological
		order.</p>
		<p class="ad_p_4">“The art of prose translation does not perhaps enjoy a very high literary
		status in England, but we have no hesitation in numbering the present
		version of Ibsen, so far as it has gone (Vols. I. and II.), among the very
		best achievements, in that kind, of our generation.”—<cite>Academy</cite>.</p>
		<p class="ad_p_4">“We have seldom, if ever, met with a translation so absolutely
		idiomatic.”—<cite>Glasgow Herald</cite>.</p>
